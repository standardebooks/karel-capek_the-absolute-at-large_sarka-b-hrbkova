<h3>THE ADVERTISEMENT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> New Year’s Day, 1943, G. H. Bondy,
head of the great Metallo-Electrical Company,
was sitting as usual reading his paper.
He skipped the news from the theatre
of war rather disrespectfully, avoided the
Cabinet crisis, then crowded on sail (for the
<span class='it'>People’s Journal</span>, which had grown long ago
to five times its ancient size, now afforded
enough canvas for an ocean voyage) for the
Finance and Commerce section. Here he
cruised about for quite a while, then furled
his sails, and abandoned himself to his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Coal Crisis!” he said to himself.
“Mines getting worked out; the Ostrava
basin suspending work for years. Heavens
above, it’s a sheer disaster! We’ll have to
import Upper Silesian coal. Just work
out what that will add to the cost of our
manufactures, and then talk about competition.
We’re in a pretty fix. And if
Germany raises her tariff, we may as well
shut up shop. And the Industrial Banks
going down, too! What a wretched state
of affairs! What a hopeless, stupid, stifling
state of affairs! Oh, damn the crisis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here G. H. Bondy, Chairman of the
Board of Directors, came to a pause.
Something was fidgeting him and would
not let him rest. He traced it back to the
last page of his discarded newspaper. It
was the syllable <span class='sc'>t i o n</span>, only part of a word,
for the fold of the paper came just in front
of the <span class='sc'>t</span>. It was this very incompleteness
which had so curiously impressed itself
upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, hang it, it’s probably <span class='sc'>iron production</span>,”
Bondy pondered vaguely, “or
<span class='sc'>prevention</span>, or, maybe, <span class='sc'>restitution</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And the Azote shares have gone down, too.
The stagnation’s simply shocking. The
position’s so bad that it’s ridiculous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But that’s nonsense: who would advertise the
<span class='sc'>restitution</span> of anything? More likely <span class='sc'>resignation</span>.
It’s sure to be <span class='sc'>resignation</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a touch of annoyance, G. H. Bondy
spread out the newspaper to dispose of this
irritating word. It had now vanished amid
the chequering of the small advertisements.
He hunted for it from one column to
another, but it had concealed itself with
provoking ingenuity. Mr. Bondy then
worked from the bottom up, and finally
started again from the right-hand side of
the page. The contumacious “tion” was
not to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bondy did not give in. He refolded
the paper along its former creases, and
behold, the detestable <span class='sc'>tion</span> leaped forth on
the very edge. Keeping his finger firmly
on the spot, he swiftly spread the paper out
once more, and found——Mr. Bondy
swore under his breath. It was nothing
but a very modest, very commonplace small
advertisement:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Invention.</span></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Highly remunerative, suitable for any factory, for
immediate sale, personal reasons. Apply R. Marek,
Engineer, Břevnov, 1651.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s all it was!” thought G. H.
Bondy. “Some sort of patent braces; just
a cheap swindle or some crazy fellow’s pet
plaything. And here I’ve wasted five
minutes on it! I’m getting scatter-brained
myself. What a wretched state of affairs!
And not a hint of improvement anywhere!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He settled himself in a rocking-chair to
savour in more comfort the full bitterness
of this wretched state of affairs. True, the
M.E.C. had ten factories and 34,000 employees.
The M.E.C. was the leading
producer of iron. The M.E.C. had no
competitor as regards boilers. The M.E.C.
grates were world-famous. But after thirty
years’ hard work, gracious Heavens, surely
one would have got bigger results elsewhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy sat up with a jerk. “R.
Marek, Engineer; R. Marek, Engineer.
Half a minute: mightn’t that be that red-haired
Marek—let’s see, what was his
name? Rudolph, Rudy Marek, my old
chum Rudy of the Technical School?
Sure enough, here it is in the advertisement:
‘R. Marek, Engineer.’ Rudy, you
rascal, is it possible? Well, you’ve not got
on very far in the world, my poor fellow!
Selling ‘a highly remunerative invention.’
Ha! ha! ‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for personal reasons.’ We
know all about those ‘personal reasons.’
No money, isn’t that what it is? You want
to catch some jay of a manufacturer on a
nicely limed ‘patent,’ do you? Ah, well,
you always had rather a notion of turning
the world upside down. Ah, my lad, where
are all our fine notions now! And those
extravagant, romantic days when we were
young!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy lay back in his chair once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite likely it really is Marek,” he
reflected. “Still, Marek had a head for
science. He was a bit of a talker, but there
was a touch of genius about the lad. He
had ideas. In other respects he was a fearfully
unpractical fellow. An absolute fool,
in fact. It’s very surprising that he isn’t
a Professor,” mused Mr. Bondy. “I
haven’t set eyes on him for twenty years.
God knows what he has been up to; perhaps
he’s come right down in the world. Yes,
he must be down and out, living away over in
Břevnov, poor chap .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and getting a living
out of inventions! What an awful finish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to imagine the straits of the
fallen inventor. He managed to picture
a horribly shaggy and dishevelled head,
surrounded by dismal paper walls like those
in a film. There is no furniture, only a
mattress in the corner, and a pitiful model
made of spools, nails, and match-ends on the
table. A murky window looks out on a
little yard. Upon this scene of unspeakable
indigence enters a visitor in rich furs.
“I have come to have a look at your invention.”
The half-blind inventor fails to recognize
his old schoolfellow. He humbly bows
his tousled head, looks about for a seat
to offer to his guest, and then, oh Heaven!
with his poor, stiff, shaking fingers he tries
to get his sorry invention going—it’s some
crazy perpetual motion device—and mumbles
confusedly that it should work, and certainly
<span class='it'>would</span> work, if only he had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if
only he could buy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The fur-coated
visitor looks all round the garret, and
suddenly he takes a leather wallet from
his pocket and lays on the table one, two
(Mr. Bondy takes fright and cries “That’s
enough!”) three thousand-crown notes.
(“One would have been quite enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
to go on with, I mean,” protests something
in Mr. Bondy’s brain.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something to carry on
the work with, Mr. Marek. No, no, you’re
not in any way indebted to me. Who am
I? That doesn’t matter. Just take it that
I am a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy found this scene very pleasant
and touching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send my secretary to Marek,” he
resolved; “to-morrow without fail. And
what shall I do to-day? It’s a holiday;
I’m not going to the works. My time’s
my own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a wretched state things are
in! Nothing to do all day long! Suppose
I went round to-day myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy hesitated. It would be
a bit of an adventure to go and see for
oneself how that queer fellow was struggling
along in Břevnov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, we were such chums! And
old times have their claim on one. Yes,
I’ll go!” decided Mr. Bondy. And he
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had rather a boring time while his
car was gliding all over Břevnov in search
of a mean hovel bearing the number 1651.
They had to inquire at the police-station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marek, Marek,” said the inspector,
searching his memory. “That must be
Marek the engineer, of Marek and Co.,
the electric lamp factory, 1651, Mixa
Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The electric lamp factory! Bondy felt
disappointed, even annoyed. Rudy Marek
wasn’t living up in a garret, then! He
was a manufacturer and wanted to sell some
invention or other “for personal reasons.”
If that didn’t smell of bankruptcy, his name
wasn’t Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you happen to know how Mr.
Marek is doing?” he asked the police
inspector, with a casual air, as he took his
seat in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, splendidly!” the inspector answered.
“He’s got a very fine business.” Local
pride made him add, “The firm’s very well
known”; and he amplified this with: “A
very wealthy man, and a learned one, too.
He does nothing but make experiments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mixa Street!” cried Bondy to his
chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Third on the right!” the inspector
called after the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy was soon ringing at the residential
part of quite a pretty little factory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very nice and clean here,” he
remarked to himself. “Flower-beds in the
yard, creeper on the walls. Humph! There
always was a touch of the philanthropist
and reformer about that confounded Marek.”
And at that moment Marek himself came
out on the steps to meet him; Rudy Marek,
awfully thin and serious-looking, up in the
clouds, so to speak. It gave Bondy a queer
pang to find him neither so young as he
used to be nor so unkempt as that inventor;
so utterly different from what Bondy had
imagined that he was scarcely recognizable.
But before he could fully realize
his disillusionment, Marek stretched out
his hand and said quietly, “Well, so
you’ve come at last, Bondy! I’ve been
expecting you!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<h3>THE KARBURATOR</h3>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>I’ve</span> been expecting you!” Marek repeated,
when he had seated his guest in a
comfortable leather chair. Nothing on
earth would have induced Bondy to own up
to his vision of the fallen inventor. “Just
fancy!” he said, with a rather forced
gaiety. “What a coincidence! It struck
me only this very morning that we hadn’t
seen one another for twenty years. Twenty
years, Rudy, think of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm,” said Marek. “And so you
want to buy my invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy it?” said G. H. Bondy hesitatingly.
“I really don’t know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven’t even
given it a thought. I wanted to see you
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, you needn’t pretend,” Marek
interrupted him. “I knew that you were
coming. You’d be sure to, for a thing like
this. This kind of invention is just in your
line. There’s a lot to be done with it.”
He made an eloquent motion with his hand,
coughed, and began again more deliberately.
“The invention I am going to show you
means a bigger revolution in technical
methods than Watt’s invention of the steam-engine.
To give you its nature briefly, it
provides, putting it theoretically, for the
<span class='it'>complete utilization of atomic energy</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy concealed a yawn. “But tell me,
what have you been doing all these twenty
years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek glanced at him with some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Modern science teaches that all matter—that
is to say, its atoms—is composed of
a vast number of units of energy. An atom
is in reality a collection of electrons, i.e. of
the tiniest particles of electricity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s tremendously interesting,” Bondy
broke in. “I was always weak in physics,
you know. But you’re not looking well,
Marek. By the way, how did you happen
to come by this playth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this, er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
factory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Oh, quite by accident. I invented
a new kind of filament for electric bulbs.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that’s nothing; I only came upon
it incidentally. You see, for twenty years
I’ve been working on the combustion of
matter. Tell me yourself, Bondy, what is
the greatest problem of modern industry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing business,” said Bondy. “And
are you married yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a widower,” answered Marek,
leaping up excitedly. “No, business has
nothing to do with it, I tell you. It’s
combustion. The complete utilization of
the heat-energy contained in matter! Just
consider that we use hardly one hundred-thousandth
of the heat that there is in coal,
and that could be extracted from it! Do you
realize that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, coal is terribly dear!” said Mr.
Bondy sapiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek sat down and cried disgustedly,
“Look here, if you haven’t come here about
my Karburator, Bondy, you can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, then,” Bondy returned,
anxious to conciliate him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek rested his head in his hands, and
after a struggle came out with, “For twenty
years I’ve been working on it, and now—now,
I’ll sell it to the first man who comes
along! My magnificent dream! The
greatest invention of all the ages! Seriously,
Bondy, I tell you, it’s something really
amazing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt, in the present wretched
state of affairs,” assented Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, without any qualification at all,
amazing. Do you realize that it means the
utilization of atomic energy without any
residue whatever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha,” said Bondy. “So we’re going
to do our heating with atoms. Well,
why not? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’ve got a nice place
here, Rudy. Small and pleasant. How
many hands do you employ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek took no notice. “You know,”
he said thoughtfully, “it’s all the same
thing, whatever you call it—the utilization
of atomic energy, or the complete combustion
of matter, or the disintegration of
matter. You can call it what you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in favour of ‘combustion’!” said
Mr. Bondy. “It sounds more familiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ‘disintegration’ is more exact—to
break up the atoms into electrons, and
harness the electrons and make them work.
Do you understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly,” Bondy assured him. “The
point is to harness them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, imagine, say, that there are two
horses at the ends of a rope, pulling with
all their might in opposite directions. Do
you know what you have then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some kind of sport, I suppose,” suggested
Mr. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, a state of repose. The horses pull,
but they stay where they are. And if you
were to cut the rope——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—The horses would fall over,” cried
G. H. Bondy, with a flash of inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but they would start running;
they would become energy released. Now,
pay attention. Matter is a team in that
very position. Cut the bonds that hold its
electrons together, and they will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run loose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but we can catch and harness them,
don’t you see? Or put it to yourself this
way: we burn a piece of coal, say, to
produce heat. We do get a little heat
from it, but we also get ashes, coal-gas, and
soot. So we don’t lose the matter altogether,
do we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.—Won’t you have a cigar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t.—But the matter which is
left still contains a vast quantity of unused
atomic energy. If we used up the whole
of the atomic energy, we should use up the
whole of the atoms. In short, <span class='it'>the matter
would vanish altogether</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha! Now I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just as though we were to grind
corn badly—as if we ground up the thin
outer husk and threw the rest away, just as
we throw away ashes. When the grinding
is perfect, there’s nothing or next to nothing
left of the grain, is there? In the same way,
when there is perfect combustion, there’s
nothing or next to nothing left of the matter
we burn. It’s ground up completely. It is
used up. It returns to its original nothingness.
You know, it takes a tremendous
amount of energy to make matter exist
at all. Take away its existence, compel it not
to be, and you thereby release an enormous
supply of power. That’s how it is, Bondy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha. That’s not bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pflüger, for instance, calculates that one
kilogramme of coal contains twenty-three
billions of calories. I think that Pflüger
exaggerates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decidedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have arrived at seven billions myself,
theoretically. But even that signifies that
one kilogramme of coal, if it underwent
complete combustion, would run a good-sized
factory for several hundred hours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil it does!” cried Mr. Bondy,
springing from his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t give you the exact number of
hours. I’ve been burning half a kilogramme
of coal for six weeks at a pressure
of thirty kilogrammetres and, man alive,”
said the engineer in a whisper, turning pale,
“it’s still going on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy was embarrassed; he stroked his
smooth round chin. “Listen, Marek,” he
began, hesitatingly. “You’re surely .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a bit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. overworked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek’s hand thrust the suggestion aside.
“Not a bit of it. If you’d only get up
physics a bit, I could give you an explanation
of my Karburator<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> in which the combustion
takes place. It involves a whole chapter of
advanced physics, you know. But you’ll
see it downstairs in the cellar. I shovelled
half a kilogramme of coal into the machine,
then I shut it up and had it officially sealed
in the presence of witnesses, so that no one
could put any more coal in. Go and have a
look at it for yourself—go on—go now!
You won’t understand it, anyway, but—go
down to the cellar! Go on down, man,
I tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This name which Marek gave to his atomic boiler
is, of course, quite incorrect, and is one of the melancholy
results of the ignorance of Latin among technicians. A
more exact term would have been Komburator, Atomic
Kettle, Karbowatt, Disintegrator, Motor M, Bondymover,
Hylergon, Molecular Disintegration Dynamo, E.W., and
other designations which were later proposed. It was,

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you come with me?” asked
Bondy in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you go alone. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say,
Bondy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don’t stay down there long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Bondy, growing a
trifle suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing much. Only I’ve a notion
that perhaps it’s not quite healthy down
there. Turn on the light, the switch is
just by the door. That noise down in the
cellar doesn’t come from my machine. It
works noiselessly, steadily, and without any
smell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The roaring is only a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
ventilator. Well, now, you go on. I’ll wait
here. Then you can tell me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy went down the cellar steps, quite
glad to be away from that madman for a
while (quite mad, no doubt whatever about
it) and rather worried as to the quickest
means of getting out of the place altogether.
Why, just look, the cellar had a huge
thick reinforced door just like an armour-plated
safe in a bank. And now let’s have
a light. The switch was just by the door.
And there in the middle of the arched
concrete cellar, clean as a monastery cell,
lay a gigantic copper cylinder resting on
cement supports. It was closed on all sides
except at the top, where there was a grating
bedecked with seals. Inside the machine
all was darkness and silence. With a
smooth and regular motion the cylinder
thrust forth a piston which slowly rotated
a heavy fly-wheel. That was all. Only the
ventilator in the cellar window kept up a
ceaseless rattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was the draught from the
ventilator or something—but Mr. Bondy
felt a peculiar breeze upon his brow, and
an eerie sensation as though his hair were
standing on end; and then it seemed as if
he were being borne through boundless
space; and then as though he were floating
in the air without any sensation of his own
weight. G. H. Bondy fell on his knees, lost
in a bewildering, shining ecstasy. He felt
as if he must shout and sing, he seemed to
hear about him the rustle of unceasing and
innumerable wings. And suddenly someone
seized him violently by the hand and
dragged him from the cellar. It was Marek,
wearing over his head a mask or a helmet
like a diver’s, and he hauled Bondy up the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up in the room he pulled off his metal
head-covering and wiped away the sweat
that soaked his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only just in time,” he gasped, showing
tremendous agitation.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h3>PANTHEISM</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>G. H. Bondy</span> felt rather as though he were
dreaming. Marek settled him in an easy
chair with quite maternal solicitude, and
made haste to bring some brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, drink this up quickly,” he jerked
out hoarsely, offering him the glass with a
trembling hand. “<span class='it'>You</span> came over queer
down there too, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” Bondy answered unsteadily.
“It was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was beautiful,
old chap! I felt as if I were flying, or
something like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Marek quickly. “That’s
exactly what I mean. As though you were
flying along, or rather soaring upward,
wasn’t that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a feeling of perfect bliss,” said
Mr. Bondy. “I think it’s what you’d
call being transported. As if there was
something down there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something—holy?” asked Marek hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. Yes, man alive, you’re right.
I never go to church, Rudy, never in my
life, but down in that cellar I felt as if I
were in church. Tell me, man, what did
I do down there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You went on your knees,” Marek
muttered with a bitter smile, and began
striding up and down the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy stroked his bald head in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s extraordinary. But come, on my
knees? Well, then, tell me what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what
is there in the cellar that acts on one so
queerly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Karburator,” growled Marek, gnawing
his lips. His cheeks seemed even more
sunken than before, and were as pale as
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, confound it, man,” cried Bondy
in amazement, “how can it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The engineer only shrugged his shoulders,
and with bent head went on pacing up and
down the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy’s eyes followed him with
childish astonishment. “The man’s crazy,”
he said to himself. “All the same, what
the devil is it that comes over one in that
cellar? That tormenting bliss, that tremendous
security, that terror, that overwhelming
feeling of devotion, or whatever
you like to call it.” Mr. Bondy arose and
poured himself out another dash of brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Marek,” he said, “I’ve got it
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got what?” exclaimed Marek, halting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That business in the cellar. That
queer psychical condition. It’s some form
of poisoning, isn’t it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek gave an angry laugh. “Oh, yes,
of course, poisoning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so at once,” declared Bondy,
his mind at rest in an instant. “That
apparatus of yours produces something, ah
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something like ozone, doesn’t
it? Or more likely poisonous gas. And
when anyone inhales it, it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
poisons him or excites him somehow, isn’t
that it? Why, of course, man, it’s nothing
but poisonous gases; they’re probably given
off somehow by the combustion of the coal
in that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that Karburator of yours.
Some sort of illuminating gas or paradise
gas, or phosgene or something of the sort.
That’s why you’ve put in the ventilator, and
that’s why you wear a gas-mask when you
go into the cellar, isn’t it? Just some
confounded gases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only there were nothing but <span class='it'>gases</span>!”
Marek burst out, shaking his fists threateningly.
“Look here, Bondy, that’s why I
must sell that Karburator! I simply can’t
stand it—I can’t stand it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>I can’t stand
it</span>,” he shouted, well-nigh weeping. “I
never dreamed my Karburator would do
anything like <span class='it'>this</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. terrifying
mischief! Just think, it’s been going on
like <span class='it'>that</span> from the very beginning! And
every one feels it who comes near the thing.
You haven’t any notion even yet, Bondy.
But our porter caught it properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow!” said the astonished
Bondy, full of sympathy. “And did he
die of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but he got <span class='it'>converted</span>,” cried Marek
in despair. “Bondy, you’re a man I can
confide in. My invention, my Karburator,
has one terrible defect. Nevertheless, you’re
going to buy it or else take it from me as a
gift. You will, Bondy—even if it spews
forth demons. It doesn’t matter to you,
Bondy, so long as you can get your millions
out of it. And you’ll get them, man. It’s
a stupendous thing, I tell you——; but I
don’t want to have anything more to do with
it. You haven’t such a sensitive conscience
as I have, you know, Bondy. It’ll bring in
millions, thousands of millions; but it will
lay a frightful load upon your conscience.
Make up your mind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, leave me alone,” Mr. Bondy protested.
“If it gives off poisonous gases,
the authorities will prohibit it, and there’s
an end of it. You know the wretched state
of affairs here. Now in America .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t poisonous gases,” Marek exclaimed.
“It’s <span class='it'>something a thousand times
worse</span>. Mark what I tell you, Bondy, it’s
something beyond human reason, but there’s
not a scrap of deception about it. Well,
then, my Karburator actually does burn up
matter, causes its utter combustion, so that
not even a grain of dust remains. Or
rather, it breaks it up, crushes it, splits it
up into electrons, consumes it, grinds it—I
don’t know how to express it—in short,
uses it up completely. You have no idea
what a colossal amount of energy is contained
in the atoms. With half a hundredweight
of coal in the Karburator you can sail right
round the world in a steamship, you can
light the whole city of Prague, you can
supply power for the whole of a huge factory,
or anything you like. A bit of coal the size
of a nut will do the heating and the cooking
for a whole family. And ultimately we
shan’t even require coal; we can do our
heating with the first pebble or handful of
dirt we pick up in front of the house.
Every scrap of matter has in it more energy
than an enormous boiler; you’ve only to
extract it. You’ve only to know how to
secure total combustion! Well, Bondy, I
can do it; my Karburator can do it. You’ll
admit, Bondy, that it has been worth while
toiling over it for twenty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Rudy,” Bondy began slowly,
“it’s all very extraordinary—but I believe
you, so to speak. On my soul, I do believe
you. You know, when I stood in front of
that Karburator of yours, I felt that I was
in the presence of something overpoweringly
great, something a man could not withstand.
I can’t help it: I believe you. Down there
in the cellar you have something uncanny,
something that will overturn the whole
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, Bondy,” Marek whispered anxiously,
“that’s just where the trouble is.
Listen, and I’ll tell you the whole thing.
Have you ever read Spinoza?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more had I. But now, you see,
I’m beginning to read that sort of thing.
I don’t understand it—it’s terribly difficult
stuff for us technical people—but there’s
something in it. Do you by any chance
believe in God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Well, now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” G. H. Bondy
deliberated. “Upon my word, I couldn’t
say. Perhaps there is a God, but He’s on
some other planet. Not on ours. Oh, well,
that sort of thing doesn’t fit in with our
times at all. Tell me, what makes you drag
that into it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe in anything,” said Marek
in a hard voice. “I don’t want to believe.
I have always been an atheist. I believed
in matter and in progress and in nothing
else. I’m a scientific man, Bondy; and
science cannot admit the existence of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the business point of view,” Mr.
Bondy remarked, “it’s a matter of indifference.
If He wants to exist, in Heaven’s
name, let Him. We aren’t mutually exclusive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But from the scientific point of view,
Bondy,” cried the engineer sternly, “it is
absolutely intolerable. It’s a case of Him
or science. I don’t assert that God does
not exist; I only assert that He ought not
to exist, or at least <span class='it'>ought</span> not to let Himself
be seen. And I believe that science
is crowding Him out step by step, or at
any rate is preventing Him from letting
Himself be seen; and I believe that that is
the greatest mission of science.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” said Bondy calmly. “But
go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now just imagine, Bondy, that——But
wait, I’ll put it to you this way. Do
you know what Pantheism is? It’s the belief
that God, or the Absolute, if you prefer it,
is manifest in everything that exists. In
men, as in stones, in the grass, the water—everywhere.
And do you know what Spinoza
teaches? That matter is only the outward
manifestation, only one phase of the divine
substance, the other phase of which is spirit.
And do you know what Fechner teaches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” the other admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fechner teaches that everything, everything
that is, is penetrated with the divine,
that God fills with His being the whole
of the matter in the world. And do you
know Leibniz? Leibniz teaches that physical
matter is composed of psychical atoms,
monads, whose nature is divine. What do
you say to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said G. H. Bondy. “I
don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor do I. It’s fearfully abstruse. But
let us assume, for the sake of argument,
that God is contained in all forms of physical
matter, that He is, as it were, imprisoned
in it. And when you smash this matter up
completely, He flies out of it as though from
a box. He is suddenly set free. He is
released from matter as illuminating gas is
from coal. You have only to burn one
single atom up completely, and immediately
the whole cellar is filled with the Absolute.
It’s simply appalling how quickly it spreads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on,” Mr. Bondy interrupted.
“Say that all over again, but say it slowly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at it like this then,” said Marek.
“We’re assuming that all matter contains
the Absolute in some state of confinement.
We can call it a latent imprisoned force, or
simply say that as God is omnipresent He is
therefore present in all matter and in every
particle of matter. And now suppose you
utterly destroy a piece of matter, apparently
leaving not the slightest residue. Then,
since all matter is really Matter plus Absolute,
what you have destroyed is <span class='it'>only</span> the matter,
and you’re left with an indestructible residue—free
and active Absolute. You’re left
with the chemically unanalysable, immaterial
residue, which shows no spectrum lines,
neither atomic weight nor chemical affinity,
no obedience to Boyle’s law, none, none whatever,
of the properties of matter. What is
left behind is pure God. A chemical nullity
which acts with monstrous energy. Being
immaterial, it is not subject to the laws of
matter. Thence it already follows that its
manifestations are contrary to nature and
downright miraculous. All this proceeds
from the assumption that God is present in
all matter. Can you imagine, for the sake
of argument, that He is really so present?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly can,” said Bondy. “What
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Marek, rising to his feet.
“Then <span class='it'>it’s the solemn truth</span>.”</p>

<h3>GOD IN THE CELLAR</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>G. H. Bondy</span> sucked meditatively at his
cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how did you find it out, old chap?”
he asked at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the effect on myself,” said the
engineer, resuming his march up and down
the room. “As a result of its complete
disintegration of matter, my Perfect Karburator
manufactures a by-product: pure
and unconfined Absolute, God in a chemically
pure form. At one end, so to speak,
it emits mechanical power, and at the other,
the divine principle. Just as when you split
water up into hydrogen and oxygen, only on
an immensely larger scale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm,” said Mr. Bondy. “And then—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve an idea,” continued Marek cautiously,
“that there are many of the elect who
can separate the material substance in themselves
from the divine substance. They can
release or distil the Absolute, as it were,
from their material selves. Christ and the
miracle-workers, fakirs, mediums, and prophets
have achieved it by means of their
psychic power. My Karburator does it by
a purely mechanical process. It acts, you
might say, as a factory for the Absolute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facts,” said G. H. Bondy. “Stick to
facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are facts. I constructed my
Perfect Karburator only in theory to begin
with. Then I made a little model, which
wouldn’t go. The fourth model was the
first that really worked. It was only about
so big, but it ran quite nicely. But even
while I was working with it on this small
scale, I felt peculiar psychical effects—a
strange exhilaration—a ‘fey’ feeling. But
I thought it was due to being so pleased
about the invention, or to being overworked,
perhaps. It was then that I first began to
prophesy and perform miracles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To do <span class='it'>what</span>?” Bondy cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To prophesy and perform miracles,”
Marek repeated gloomily. “I had moments
of astounding illumination. I saw, for
instance, quite clearly, things that would
happen in the future. I predicted even
your visit here. And once I tore my nail
off on a lathe. I looked at the damaged
finger, and all at once a new nail grew on
it. Very likely I’d formed the wish, but
all the same it’s queer and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. terrible.
Another time—just think of it—I rose right
up into the air. It’s called levitation, you
know. I never believed in any rubbish of
that kind, so you can imagine the shock it
gave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can quite believe it,” said Bondy
gravely. “It must be most distressing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extremely distressing. I thought it must
be due to nerves, a kind of auto-suggestion
or something. In the meanwhile I erected
the big Karburator in the cellar and started
it off. As I told you, it’s been running
now for six weeks, day and night. And it
was there that I first realized the full significance
of the business. In a single day the
cellar was chock-full of the Absolute, ready
to burst with it; and it began to spread all
over the house. The pure Absolute penetrates
all matter, you know, but it takes a
little longer with solid substances. In the
air it spreads as swiftly as light. When I
went in, I tell you, man, it took me like a
stroke. I shrieked out aloud. I don’t
know where I got the strength to run
away. When I got upstairs, I thought
over the whole business. My first notion
was that it must be some new intoxicating,
stimulating gas, developed by the
process of complete combustion. That’s
why I had that ventilator fixed up, from the
outside. Two of the fitters on the job “saw
the light” and had visions; the third was
a drinker and so perhaps to some extent
immune. As long as I thought it was only
a gas, I made a series of experiments with
it, and it’s interesting to find that any light
burns much more brightly in the Absolute.
If it would let itself be confined in glass
bulbs, I’d fill lamps with it; but it escapes
from any vessel, however thick you make it.
Then I decided it must be some sort of
Ultra-X-ray, but there’s no trace of any form
of electricity, and it makes no impression on
photo-sensitive plates. On the third day, the
porter and his wife, who live just over the
cellar, had to be taken off to the sanatorium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” asked Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got religion. He was inspired. He
gave religious addresses and performed
miracles. His wife uttered prophecies. My
porter had been a thoroughly hard-headed
chap, a monist and a free-thinker, and an
unusually steady fellow. Well, just fancy,
from no visible cause whatever, he started
healing people by laying on of hands.
Of course, Bondy, he was reported at
once. The district health officer, who is a
friend of mine, was tremendously upset
about it; so, to avoid any scandal, I had
the porter sent to a sanatorium. They say
he’s better now; quite cured. He has lost
the power to perform miracles. I’m going
to send him on the land to recuperate
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then I began to work miracles myself
and see into the future. Among other
things, I had visions of gigantic, swampy
primeval forests, overgrown with mosses
and inhabited by weird monsters—probably
because the Karburator was burning
Upper Silesian coal, which is of the oldest
formation. Possibly the God of the Carboniferous
Age is in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bondy shuddered. “Marek, this is
frightful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed,” said Marek sorrowfully.
“Gradually I began to see that it wasn’t
gas, but the Absolute. The symptoms were
terrible. I could read people’s thoughts,
light emanated from me, I had a desperate
struggle not to become absorbed in prayer
and preach belief in God. I tried to clog
the Karburator up with sand, but I was
seized with a bout of levitation. That
machine won’t let anything stop it. I
don’t sleep at home nowadays. Even in
the factory there have been several serious
cases of illumination among the workmen.
I don’t know where to turn, Bondy. Yes,
I’ve tried every possible isolating material
that might prevent the Absolute from getting
out of the cellar. Ashes, sand, metal walls,
nothing can keep it back. I’ve even tried
covering the cellar with the works of Professor
Krejči, Spencer, Haeckel, and all the
Positivists you can think of: would you
believe it, the Absolute goes calmly through
even that stuff! Even papers, prayer-books,
Lives of the Saints, Patriotic Songbooks,
university lectures, best-sellers, political
treatises, and Parliamentary Reports,
present no obstacle to it. I’m simply
desperate. You can’t shut it up, you can’t
soak it up. It’s mischief let loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but why?” said Mr. Bondy.
“Does it really mean such mischief? Even
if all this were true .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is it such a
disaster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bondy, my Karburator is a terrific thing.
It will overturn the whole world, mechanically
and socially. It will cheapen production
to an unbelievable extent. It will do
away with poverty and hunger. It will
some day save our planet from freezing up.
But, on the other hand, it hurls God as a
by-product into the world. I implore you,
Bondy, don’t underrate what it means. We
aren’t used to reckoning with God as a
<span class='it'>reality</span>. We don’t know what His presence
may bring about—say, socially, morally,
and so on. Why, man, this thing affects
the whole of human civilization!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” said Bondy thoughtfully.
“Perhaps there’s some charm or
other that would exorcise it. Have you
called in the clergy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of clergy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any kind. The denomination probably
makes no difference in this case, you
know. Perhaps they could do something
to stop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all superstition!” burst out
Marek. “Leave me alone with your parsons!
Catch me giving them a chance to make a
miraculous shrine out of my cellar! Me,
with my views!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” declared Mr. Bondy. “Then
I’ll call them in myself. You never can tell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Come, it can’t do any harm, anyway.
After all, I haven’t anything against God.
Only He oughtn’t to interfere with business.
Have you tried negotiating with Him in a
friendly spirit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” admitted the engineer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a mistake,” said Bondy dryly.
“Perhaps you could come to some agreement
with Him. A proper formal contract,
in something like this style: ‘We guarantee
to produce You discreetly and continuously
to an extent to be fixed by mutual agreement;
in return for which You pledge
yourself to refrain from any divine manifestations
within such and such a radius
from the place of origin.’ What do you
think—would He consider these terms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” answered Marek uneasily.
“He seems to have a decided
inclination in favour of becoming independent
of matter once more. Still, perhaps
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in His own interests .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He might
be willing to listen. But don’t ask me to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then!” Bondy agreed. “I’ll
send my own solicitor. A very tactful and
capable fellow. And then again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one might perhaps offer Him some
church or other. After all, a factory cellar
and its surroundings are rather .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
undignified quarters for Him. We ought
to ascertain His tastes. Have you tried
yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it would suit me best to flood the
cellar with water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gently, Marek, gently. I’m probably
going to buy this invention. You understand,
of course, that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll send my
experts over first .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’ll have to look
into the business a little further. Perhaps
it’s only poisonous fumes, after all. And
if it actually turns out to be God Himself,
that’s all right. So long as the Karburator
really works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek got up. “And you wouldn’t be
afraid to install the Karburator in the M.E.C.
works?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid,” said Bondy, rising, “to
manufacture Karburators wholesale. Karburators
for trains and ships. Karburators
for central heating, for houses, offices, factories,
and schools. In ten years’ time all
the heating in the world will be done by
Karburators. I’ll give you three per cent,
of the gross profits. The first year it will
only be a few millions, perhaps. Meanwhile
you can move out, so that I can send my
men along. I’ll bring the Suffragan Bishop
up to-morrow morning. See that you keep
out of his way, Rudy. I don’t like seeing
you about here in any case. You are rather
abrupt, and I don’t want to offend the
Absolute to start with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bondy,” Marek whispered, horror-stricken.
“I warn you for the last time.
It means letting God loose upon this world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said G. H. Bondy, with dignity,
“He will be personally indebted to me to
that extent. And I hope that He won’t
show me any ill-feeling.”</p>

<h3>BISHOP LINDA</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>About</span> a fortnight after New Year’s Day,
Marek was sitting in Bondy’s business
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far have you got?” Bondy had
just asked, raising his head from some
papers over which he was bending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve finished,” said the engineer. “I’ve
given your engineers detailed drawings of
the Karburator. That bald-headed fellow—what’s
his name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Krolmus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Krolmus has simplified my atomic
motor amazingly—the transformation of
electronic energy into motor power, you
know. He’s an able fellow, my boy, is
Krolmus. And what other news is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy went on writing assiduously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re building,” he said after a while.
“Seven thousand bricklayers on the job.
A factory for Karburators.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Vysočany. And we’ve increased
our share capital. A billion and a half.
Our new invention’s getting into the papers.
See for yourself,” he added, tipping half a
hundredweight of Czech and foreign papers
into Marek’s lap, then buried himself in
the documents on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t been for a fortnight,” said
Marek gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t been where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t been to my little factory out
at Břevnov for a fortnight. I—I daren’t
go there. Is anything being done there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mphm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about my Karburator?” asked
Marek, controlling his anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s still running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the other thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief sighed and laid down his pen,
“Do you know that we had to have Mixa
Street closed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People kept going there to pray. Whole
processions of them. The police tried to
disperse them, and seven people lost their
lives. They let themselves be knocked over
like sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feared as much, I feared as much,”
muttered Marek in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve blocked the street with barbed
wire,” Bondy went on. “We had to clear
the people out of the neighbouring houses—religious
manifestations all over them, you
know. A commission of the Ministries of
Health and Education is occupying them
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect,” said Marek with a breath of
relief, “that the authorities will prohibit
my Karburator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, they won’t,” said G. H. Bondy.
“The Clerical party are making a fearful
row about your Karburator, and for that
very reason the progressive parties have
taken it under their wing. In reality no
one knows what it’s all about. It’s evident
that you don’t read the papers, man. It’s
developed into a quite needless attack upon
clericalism, and the Church happens to
have a little right on its side in this case.
That confounded Bishop informed the Cardinal
Archbishop——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Bishop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, some Bishop by the name of
Linda, quite a sensible man in other respects.
You see, I took him up <span class='it'>there</span> as an expert,
to inspect the wonder-working Absolute.
His inspection lasted a full three hours, and
he spent the whole time in the cellar,
and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got religion?” burst out Marek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it! Perhaps he’s had
too long a training with God, or else
he’s a more hard-baked atheist than you;
I don’t know. But three days later he
came to me and told me that from the
Catholic standpoint God cannot be brought
into the matter, that the Church absolutely
rejects and forbids the pantheistic hypothesis
as heresy. In short, that this isn’t any
legal, duly recognized God, supported by
the authority of the Church, and that, as a
priest, he must declare it false, perverse,
and heretical. He talked very reasonably,
did his Reverence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he wasn’t conscious of any supernatural
manifestations down there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He underwent them all: illumination,
miraculous powers, ecstasy, everything. He
doesn’t deny, either, that these things happen
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, tell me, how does he explain
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He simply doesn’t. He said that the
Church does not explain, but merely prescribes
or prohibits. In short, he definitely
refused to compromise the Church with
any new and untried God. At least, that’s
what I understood him to mean. Do you
know that I’ve bought that church up on
the White Mountain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the nearest one to Břevnov. It
cost me three hundred thousand, man.
Both in writing and by word of mouth I
offered it to the Absolute down in the cellar
to induce it to move over there. It’s quite
a pretty baroque church; and besides, I
expressed my readiness to undertake any
necessary alterations. And here’s a queer
thing: just a few steps from the church,
at No. 457, there was a fine case of ecstasy
the night before last—one of our erectors;
but in the church itself nothing miraculous
happened, nothing whatever. There was
even one case right out in Vokovice and
two in Košiře, while at the Petřín wireless
station there’s practically an epidemic of
religion. All the wireless operators on duty
up there are sending out ecstatic messages
of their own accord, a sort of new gospel
to the world at large: God coming down
again to the earth to ransom it, and so forth.
Just imagine the scandal! Now the progressive
papers are going for the Post Office,
and the fur’s fairly flying. They’re screaming
about Clericalism showing its horns,
and rubbish of that kind. Nobody as yet
suspects that this has any connection with
the Karburator. Marek,” Bondy added in
a whisper, “I’ll tell you something, but it’s
a dead secret. A week ago it attacked our
Minister for War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom!” cried Marek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, quietly. The Minister for War.
He ‘saw the light’ all of a sudden in his villa
at Dejvice. The following morning he
assembled the garrison of Prague, talked to
them about eternal peace, and exhorted the
troops to become martyrs. Of course he
had to resign at once. The papers stated
that his health had suddenly broken down.
And that’s how matters stand, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Dejvice already!” groaned the
engineer. “It’s terrible, Bondy, the way
it’s spreading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s amazing,” said Bondy. “The
other day a man shifted his piano from the
infected Mixa Street area out to Pankrác.
In twenty-four hours the whole house was
down with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the Chairman was interrupted. A
servant entered to announce a caller in the
person of Bishop Linda. Marek hurriedly
rose to take his leave, but Bondy forced
him to resume his seat, saying, “Just sit
still and say nothing. The Bishop’s really
a charming man.” At that moment the
Suffragan Bishop Linda came into the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a small, jolly person with gold
spectacles and a comical mouth puckered
up in clerical fashion in pleasant childish
folds. Bondy introduced Marek to him as
the owner of the ill-omened cellar at Břevnov.
The Bishop rubbed his hands with delight
while the wrathful engineer spluttered out
something about being “delighted to have
the honour,” with a dogged expression
that said clearly, “Confound you for a
canting humbug!” The Bishop pursed his
lips and turned quickly to Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began briskly, without beating about
the bush. “I’ve come to you on a very
delicate errand. Very delicate indeed,” he
repeated with relish. “We have been discussing
your .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ahem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your affair
in the Consistory. His Eminence, the
Archbishop, wishes to settle this regrettable
incident with as little publicity as possible.
You understand. This objectionable business
about the miracles. Oh, I’m sorry.
I have no wish to hurt the feelings of Mr.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the proprietor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please go on,” Marek conceded gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, in a word, the whole scandal.
His Eminence declares that from the standpoint
of both reason and faith there can
be nothing more offensive than this godless
and blasphemous perversion ‘of the laws of
Nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon!” Marek broke
out disgustedly. “Would you mind leaving
the laws of Nature to us? After all, we
don’t interfere with your dogmas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken,” cried the Bishop
gaily. “Quite mistaken. Science without
dogma is only a heap of doubts. What is
worse, your Absolute opposes the laws of
the Church. It contradicts the doctrine
of the holy sacraments. It does not regard
the traditions of the Church. It seriously
violates the doctrine of the Trinity. It
pays no attention to the apostolic succession.
It does not even submit to the rites of
exorcism. And so on. In short, it behaves
itself in a manner which we must severely
discountenance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come,” suggested Bondy propitiatingly.
“Up to the present its behaviour
has been very .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dignified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop raised his finger warningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to the present; but we don’t know
how it will behave next. Look here, Mr.
Bondy,” he suddenly said in a confidential
tone, “it is to your interest that there
should be no unpleasantness. To our interest,
too. You would like to settle it
quickly, like a practical business man. So
should we, as the representatives and servants
of the Lord. We cannot permit the rise
of some new God or possibly a new
religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank Heaven,” Mr. Bondy sighed
with relief. “I knew we should come to
an agreement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” cried the Bishop, his eyes
sparkling with happiness through his spectacles.
“An agreement, that’s the thing.
The venerable Consistory decided that in
the interests of the Church it would place
your .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Absolute provisionally
under its patronage. It would attempt to
bring it into harmony with Catholic doctrine.
It would proclaim the premises in Břevnov
known as No. 1651 a miraculous shrine and
place of pilgrimage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” growled Marek, and leaped to
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Permit me,” said the Bishop with an
imperious motion. “A miraculous shrine
and place of pilgrimage—with certain conditions,
of course. The first condition is
that on the aforesaid premises the production
of the Absolute should be limited to the
smallest possible quantity, and that it should
be only weak, almost innocuous, very much
diluted Absolute, whose manifestations would
be less uncontrollable and more irregular,
rather as at Lourdes. Otherwise we cannot
assume the responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” agreed Mr. Bondy. “And
what else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Further,” continued the Bishop, “it is
to be manufactured only from coal obtained
at Male Svantovice. As you know, there
is a miraculous shrine of the Virgin in that
district, so that with the aid of this particular
coal we might establish at No. 1651 Břevnov
a centre for the worship of Our Lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly,” assented Mr. Bondy.
“Anything more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the third place, you must bind
yourself not to manufacture the Absolute at
any other place or time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” cried G. H. Bondy, “and our
Karburators——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Will never come into operation, with
the exception of the one at Břevnov, which
remains the property of the Holy Church,
and will be under her management.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” protested G. H. Bondy.
“The Karburators <span class='it'>shall</span> be manufactured.
In three weeks’ time ten of them will be
erected. In the first six months there will
be twelve hundred. In the course of a
year, ten thousand. Our arrangements have
gone as far as that already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I tell you,” said the Bishop quietly
and sweetly, “that at the end of that year
not a single Karburator will be running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because mankind, whether believers or
unbelievers, cannot do with a real and
active God. We simply cannot, gentlemen.
It is out of the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I tell you,” Marek interposed
vehemently, “that the Karburators <span class='it'>shall</span> be
made. I’m in favour of them myself now.
I mean to have them precisely because you
don’t want them. In spite of you, my
Lord Bishop, in spite of all superstition,
in spite of all Rome! And I mean to be
the first to cry”—here the engineer took
breath, then burst out with unmelodious
enthusiasm—“Success to the Perfect Karburator!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see,” said the Bishop with a
sigh. “You gentlemen will live to be
convinced that the venerable Consistory was
right. In a year’s time you will stop the
manufacture of the Absolute of your own
accord. But, oh, the damage, the devastation
it will bring to pass in the meantime!
Gentlemen, in the name of Heaven, do not
imagine that the Church brings God into
the world. The Church merely confines
Him and controls Him. And you two unbelievers
are loosing Him upon the earth
like a flood. The ship of Peter will survive
even this deluge; like the Ark of Noah, it
will ride out this inundation of the Absolute—but
your modern society,” cried the
Bishop with a mighty voice, “<span class='it'>that</span> will pay
the price!”</p>

<h3>THE BOARD-MEETING</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Gentlemen”</span>—it was G.H. Bondy addressing
the meeting of the Board of Directors
of the M.E.C. (the Metallo-Electrical Company)
held on February 20th—“I have to
inform you that one building of our new
group of factories at Vysočany has been
completed and began production yesterday.
In a very few days the standardized production
of Karburators will be in full swing,
beginning with eighteen finished machines
per day. In April we expect to turn out
sixty-five per day; by the end of July two
hundred per day. We have laid down
fifteen kilometres of private line, chiefly
for our coal supply. Twelve boiler furnaces
are now being erected. We have begun
the building of new quarters for our workmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve boiler furnaces?” Dr. Hubka,
the leader of the opposition, asked at a
venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, twelve for the time being,” confirmed
Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s strange,” Dr. Hubka declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask you, gentlemen,” said Bondy,
“what is there strange about having twelve
boilers? For a huge group of factories
like this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course,” came from several
quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hubka smiled ironically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why the fifteen kilometres of
railway line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the transport of coal and raw
materials. We are reckoning on a daily
consumption of eight truckloads of coal
until we have things properly under way.
I don’t know what Dr. Hubka’s objection
to our getting coal in can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you my objection,” cried Dr.
Hubka, leaping up. “It’s that the whole
business looks highly suspicious. Yes, gentlemen,
extremely suspicious. Mr. Bondy
has forced us to erect a factory for Karburators.
The Karburator, he assured us,
is the only power-supply of the future. The
Karburator, as he expressly stated, can
develop a thousand horse-power from a
single bucket of coal. And now he is
talking about twelve boiler furnaces and whole
truckloads of coal for them. Gentlemen, I
ask you, why then shouldn’t a single bucket
of coal give sufficient power for our whole
factory? Why are we erecting boiler
furnaces when we’ve got atomic motors?
Gentlemen, if the Karburator is not an
utter swindle, I don’t see why our Chairman
did not arrange for our own new factory
to be equipped to be run by Karburator
power. I don’t see it, and no one else will
see it. Why hasn’t our Chairman sufficient
confidence in these Karburators of his to
install them in our own establishment?
Gentlemen, it’s a shockingly bad advertisement
for our Karburators if their manufacturer
himself will not or cannot use them.
I beg you, gentlemen, to ask Mr. Bondy
to give us his reasons. For my part, I
have formed my own opinion. That is all
I have to say, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon Dr. Hubka sat down resolutely,
and victoriously blew his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the Board of Directors
remained silent and dejected. Dr. Hubka’s
indictment was all too clear. Bondy did
not raise his eyes from his papers; not a
muscle of his face moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M—m no,” growled old Rosenthal,
anxious for peace. “Our Chairman will
explain. Yes, yes, it can all be explained,
gentlemen, I think, m—m—er, yes—very
satisfactorily. Dr. Hubka is surely mm—hm—hm—yes,
yes—with regard to what
he has told us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chairman at last raised his eyes.
“Gentlemen,” he said quietly, “I have read
you the expert report of our engineers
on the Karburator. The facts are precisely
as there-stated. The Karburator is no
swindle. We have already built ten of
them for testing purposes. They all work
perfectly. Here are the proofs. Karburator
No. 1 drives the suction pump on the
Sazava River, and has been running without
attention for fourteen days. No. 2, the
dredge on the Upper Vltava, is working
splendidly. No. 3 is in the testing laboratory
of the Brno Technical Institute. No. 4
was damaged in transport. No. 5 is supplying
the city of Hradec Králové with light.
That is the ten-kilo pattern. The five-kilo
pattern, No. 6, is running a mill at
Slaný. No. 7 has been installed to provide
central heating for a block of buildings in
the New Town. Mr. Machat, the proprietor
of that block, is with us to-day. Would
you mind, Mr. Machat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elderly gentleman of that name awoke
as from a dream. “I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were asking how your new central heating
system is working.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What heating do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your new block of buildings,” said
Bondy gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What block of buildings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your new houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my houses? I haven’t any houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, come!” Mr. Rosenthal exclaimed.
“You put them up only last year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did?” said Machat in tones of surprise.
“Oh, yes, you’re right, so I did. But,
you see, I have given those houses away
now. I gave them all away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy looked at him very attentively.
“And to whom did you give them, Mr.
Machat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Machat flushed slightly. “Well, to poor
people. I’ve let poor families occupy them.
You see, I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I came to the conclusion
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, in short, poor people have
got them now, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bondy kept his eyes on Machat
like an examining magistrate. “Why, Mr.
Machat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I couldn’t help it,” Machat
stammered. “It took me like that. Our
lives should be holy, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chairman drummed nervously on
the table. “And what about your family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Machat began to smile beatifically. “Oh,
we’re all of the same mind in that matter.
Those poor people are such saints. Some
of them are ill. My daughter is looking
after them, you know. We’ve all changed
so tremendously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy dropped his eyes. Machat’s
daughter Ellen, the fair-haired Ellen, with
her seventy millions, tending the sick!
Ellen, who was ready to be, who ought to
be, who had half consented to be, Mrs.
Bondy! Bondy bit his lip; things <span class='it'>had</span>
turned out nicely!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Machat,” he began, in subdued
tones, “I only wanted to know how the
new Karburator was doing the heating on
your premises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, splendidly! It’s so beautifully
warm in every one of the houses! Just as
though they were being warmed with eternal
love! Do you know,” said Machat rapturously,
wiping his eyes, “whoever enters
there becomes at one stroke a changed man.
It is like Paradise there. We are all living
as if we were in Heaven. Oh, come and
join us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, gentlemen,” said Bondy, controlling
himself with an effort, “that the
Karburators work exactly as I promised you
they would. I ask you to waive any further
questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We only want to know,” cried Dr.
Hubka pugnaciously, “why, in that case,
you don’t arrange for our new works to be
run by Karburator power? Why should
we use expensive coal for heating when
we’re supplying atomic energy to other
people? Is Mr. Bondy disposed to let us
have his reasons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By no means,” Bondy declared. “Our
heating will be done with coal. For
reasons known to myself, the Karburator
system will not suit our purposes. Let
that suffice, gentlemen. I regard the whole
affair as a question of confidence in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Machat made himself heard. “If you
only knew how wonderful it feels to be in
a state of holiness! Gentlemen, take my
sincere advice. Give away all that you
possess! Become poor and holy! Deliver
yourselves from Mammon, and glorify the
one God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come,” Mr. Rosenthal tried to
calm him down. “We know you for a kind
and upright man, Mr. Machat—yes, yes,
extremely so. And I have every confidence
in you, Mr. Bondy, you know. I tell you
what, send me one of those Karburators
for my own heating apparatus! I’ll give
it a trial, gentleman. What’s the use of
all this talking? What about it, Mr.
Bondy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all brothers in God’s sight!”
continued the radiant Machat. “Gentlemen,
let us give the factory to the poor!
I move that we change the M.E.C. into a
religious community of ‘The Humble of
Heart.’ Let us be the seed from which
the tree of God shall spring. The Kingdom
of God on earth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I demand a hearing,” shouted Dr.
Hubka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now, Mr. Bondy,” pleaded old
Rosenthal in mollifying tones. “You see
I am on your side! Lend me one of those
Karburators, Mr. Bondy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God Himself is descending upon
the earth,” Machat continued in great
excitement. “Hearken to His message:
Be ye holy and simple; open your hearts
to the infinite; let your love be unbounded.
Let me tell you, gentlemen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I demand the floor,” yelled Dr. Hubka
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” shouted Bondy, pale and
with gleaming eyes, as he rose with the
whole authority of his massive frame.
“Gentlemen, if the factory for Karburators
does not suit your fancy, I will take it over
under my own personal charge. I will
compensate you to the last penny for all
the expenditure so far incurred. I resign
my position, gentlemen. I beg to take my
leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hubka darted forward. “But,
gentlemen, I protest! We all protest!
We will not part with the manufacture of
Karburators! A splendid line like that,
gentlemen! No, thank you, we are not
to be hoodwinked into handing over a
valuable business. With your permission,
gentlemen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy rang the bell. “Friends,” he
said gloomily, “we will leave this for the
time being. It seems to me that our friend
Machat is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slightly indisposed.
As far as the Karburator is concerned,
gentlemen, I guarantee you a dividend of
one hundred and fifty per cent. I move
that the discussion be now closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hubka took the floor. “I move,
gentlemen, that every member of the Board
of Directors shall receive one Karburator
for testing purposes, so to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy looked at all present. His features
twitched. He tried to say something, but
he only shrugged his shoulders and hissed
between his teeth, “As you please.”</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENTS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“How</span> do we stand in London?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M.E.C. shares were quoted at 1470
yesterday. The day before yesterday they
were 750.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Marek has been made an honorary
member of ten learned societies, and is
certain to be awarded the Nobel Prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a rush of orders from Germany.
Over five thousand Karburators wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine hundred orders from Japan, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that, now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Czechoslovakia doesn’t show much interest.
Three fresh inquiries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm. That’s all one might expect. A
wretched state of affairs here, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Russian Government wants two
hundred immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! What’s the total?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen thousand orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! How far have we got with
the buildings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The division for atomic motor-cars
has got the roof on. The section for
atomic flying-machines will begin work
during the week. We are laying the foundations
for the atomic locomotive works.
One wing of the department for ships’
engines is already in operation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute. You should start
calling them atomobiles, atomotors and
atomotives, you know. How is Krolmus
getting along with the atomic cannon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s already constructing a model at
Pilsen. Our atomic cyclecar is doing its
thirty thousandth kilometre on the Brussels
racing-track. It has done two hundred
and seventy kilometres an hour. We have
had seventeen thousand orders for our half-kilo
atomotors in the last two days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A minute ago you told me that the
total was thirteen thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen thousand stationary atomic
boilers. Eight thousand of the central heating
apparatus. Nearly ten thousand
atomobiles. Sixty hundred and twenty atoplanes.
Our A.7 has flown from Prague
to Melbourne, Australia, without a stop;
all on board safe and sound. Here is the
telegram.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy drew himself up. “Why, my
young friend, that’s splendid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The agricultural machinery department
has five thousand orders in. In the
section for small power-engines, twenty-two
thousand. One hundred and fifty atomic
pumps. Three atomic presses. Twelve
atomic blast furnaces. Seventy-five atomic
wireless stations. One hundred and ten
atomic locomotives, all for Russia. We have
established general agencies in forty-eight
different capitals. The American Steel
Trust, the Berlin General Electric Company,
the Italian Fiat, Mannesmann, Creusot,
and the Swedish steel-works are all making
us offers of amalgamation. Krupp’s are paying
any price for our shares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the new issue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty-five times over-subscribed. The
financial papers predict a super-dividend of
two hundred per cent. The other papers are
talking of nothing but this business; politics,
sport, technology, science, everything’s Karburator.
We’ve had seven tons of newspaper
cuttings from our agent in Germany,
four hundredweight from France, and a
truckload from England. The scientific and
technical literature dealing with atomotors,
to be published this year, is estimated at
sixty tons. The Anglo-Japanese war has
been broken off owing to the lack of public
interest. In England alone there are nine
hundred thousand coal-miners out of work.
There has been a rising in the Belgian
coalfields; about four thousand killed.
More than half the mines in the world have
ceased working. The surplus petroleum
in Pennsylvania has set the oil-fields ablaze.
The fire’s still raging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire’s still raging,” repeated Bondy,
as though in a dream. “The fire’s still
raging. My God, then, we have won!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chairman of the Mining and Smelting
Company has shot himself. The Stock
Exchange has simply gone mad. We stand
at 8,000 to-day in Berlin. The Cabinet is
in permanent sitting, and wants to proclaim
a state of siege. This isn’t an invention,
Chief, it’s a revolution!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chairman and the General Manager
of the M.E.C. looked at each other in
silence. Neither of them was a poet, but
in that moment their very souls were singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manager drew his chair closer and
said in a low voice, “Chief, Rosenthal has
gone crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosenthal!” exclaimed G. H. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manager nodded mournfully. “He
has become an orthodox Jew, and he’s gone
in for Talmudic mysticism and Cabalism.
He has given ten millions to the cause of
Zionism. Not long ago he had a terrible
quarrel with Dr. Hubka. You’ve surely
heard that Hubka has joined the Bohemian
Brethren.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, has Hubka got it too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think the Board of Directors
must have caught it from Machat. You
were not present at the last meeting, Chief.
It was terrible; they talked religion until
morning. Hubka moved that we hand
over our establishments to the workers.
Luckily, they forgot to take a vote on it.
They were like men possessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy gnawed at his fingers. “What
on earth am I to do with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm, nothing whatever. It’s a nervous
disease of the age. Something of the sort
crops up now and again in the papers, too,
but they’re so full of the Karburators that
they haven’t space for anything else.
There’s an appalling number of cases of
religious mania. It’s a psychical epidemic
or something. The other day I saw Dr.
Hubka preaching to a crowd of people in
front of the Industrial Bank about seeking
the inward light and making straight the
path for God. Fearfully incoherent stuff.
He wound up by performing miracles.
Forst is at it too. Rosenthal is nothing
short of insane. Miller, Homola and Kolator
came out with a proposal for voluntary
poverty. We can’t possibly have another
board-meeting. It’s a regular madhouse,
Chief. You’ll have to take the whole
idiotic business in hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, man, this is simply awful,” groaned
G.H. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed. Did you hear about the
Sugar Bank? All the officials there were
seized with it at one fell swoop. They
opened the safes and gave away the money
to anyone who came. They finished by
burning bundles of banknotes on a bonfire
in the main hall. Religious Bolshevism, I
should call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Sugar Bank? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hasn’t the
Sugar Bank one of our Karburators?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. For central heating. The Sugar
Bank was the first to install one. Now the
police have closed the Bank. Even the
confidential clerks and the directors were
affected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send word round that the sale of
Karburators to banks is forbidden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forbid it, and that’s enough! Let
them do their heating with coal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bit too late. All the banks are
already putting in our heating system. It’s
being installed in the Houses of Parliament
and in all the Government departments.
The central Karburator at Stvanice, which
is to light the whole of Prague, is finished.
It is a fifty-kilo monster, a magnificent
machine. It is to be ceremoniously set in
motion at six o’clock the day after to-morrow,
in the presence of the President, the Burgomaster,
the City Council, and the representatives
of the M.E.C. You must be present.
You of all people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid!” Mr. Bondy shouted,
horror-stricken. “No, no, Heaven defend
me from that! I will not go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Chief, you must. We can’t send
Rosenthal or Hubka there. Why, they’re
raving mad. They would make dreadful
speeches. It’s the honour of the firm that’s
at stake. The Burgomaster of Prague has
prepared a speech in our honour. The
representatives of foreign Governments and
the foreign Press will be there. It’s to be
a great occasion. As soon as the street
lamps light up, military bands are going to
play salutes and fanfares in the streets,
the Male Voice Choirs and the other Choral
Societies will sing, there’ll be fireworks and
a salute of a hundred and one guns, the
Castle will be illuminated, and I don’t know
what. Chief, you simply must be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy arose in great torment of
spirit. “God! oh God!” he whispered,
“if it be possible, remove this cup.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be there?” repeated the
manager inexorably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! oh God! why hast Thou forsaken
me?”</p>

<h3>THE DREDGE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> dredge M.E.28 stood motionless in
the evening twilight above Stechovice. The
Paternoster shovel had long since ceased
heaving up the cold sand from the bed of
the Vltava River. The evening was mild
and calm, fragrant with new-mown hay and
the breath of the woodlands. A tender
orange glow still lingered in the north-west.
Here and there a wave glittered with unearthly
splendour amid the reflections of
the sky—gleamed, murmured and blent
itself with the shining surface of the stream.
A skiff was coming towards the dredge from
Stechovice. It made slow progress against
the rapid current, and stood out upon the
glowing river like a black water-beetle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone is coming over to see us,”
Kuzenda, the skipper, said quietly, from his
seat in the rear of the dredge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of ’em,” said Brych, the stoker,
after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I know who it is, too,” said
Kuzenda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sweethearts from Stechovice,” said
Brych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better make them some coffee,”
Kuzenda decided, and went below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then, youngsters,” Brych shouted
to the boat. “To the left! Left! Give
us your hand, lass. There we are. Up
she comes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me and Joe,” the girl announced on
reaching the deck, “we—we’d like to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening,” said the young workman
who climbed up after her. “Where
is Mr. Kuzenda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kuzenda is making coffee,” said the
stoker. “Take a seat. Look, there’s someone
else coming across. Is that you, baker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me,” a voice rang back. “Good
evening, Mr. Brych. I’ve got the postman
and the gamekeeper with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up then, brothers,” said Mr.
Brych. “We can begin while Mr. Kuzenda
is getting the coffee ready. Who else is
coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” came a voice from the side of
the dredge. “My name’s Hudec, and I’d
very much like to hear you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very welcome, Mr. Hudec,”
the stoker shouted down. “Come up,
will you?—there’s a ladder here. Half a
minute and I’ll give you a hand, Mr.
Hudec, seeing you’ve never been here
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brych,” three people shouted from
the bank. “Send the boat across for us,
will you? We’d like to come over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and fetch them over, you below,”
said Mr. Brych, “that all may hear the
word of God. Brothers and sister, please
sit down. It’s not dirty here now that we
do our heating with a Karburator. Brother
Kuzenda will bring you some coffee, and
then we can start. Welcome, young people.
Come right up.” With this Mr. Brych
took his place by the opening down which
ran the ladder to the interior of the dredge.
“Halloa there, Kuzenda, ten on deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right!” cried a beard-muffled voice
from the depths. “I’m just bringing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, friends, sit down,” said Brych,
briskly indicating suitable seats. “Mr.
Hudec, we have nothing but coffee here;
I don’t expect you’ll mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I?” returned Mr. Hudec.
“I just wanted to see your—to be present
at your—séance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our service,” Brych mildly corrected
him. “We are all brothers, here, you know.
Let me tell you, Mr. Hudec, that I was a
drunkard and Kuzenda was in politics, and
the grace of God came upon us, and our
brethren and sisters here,” he said, pointing
round him, “come to us in the evenings to
pray for the same gift of the spirit. The
baker here had asthma, and Kuzenda cured
him. Come now, baker, tell us yourself
how it happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kuzenda laid his hands on me,” said
the baker softly and rapturously, “and all
at once such a feeling of warmth began to
pour through my chest. You know, something
just snapped in me, and I began to
breathe as if I was flying about in the sky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit, baker,” Brych corrected him.
“Kuzenda didn’t lay his hands on you.
He hadn’t any notion he was going to work
a miracle. He simply went like this with
his hand, and then you said that you
could breathe easily. That’s the way it
was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were there when it happened,” said
the young girl from Stechovice. “And the
baker had a ring of light around his head,
and then Mr. Kuzenda charmed away my
consumption, didn’t he, Joe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young fellow from Stechovice said,
“That’s the honest truth, Mr. Hudec. But
what happened to me is queerer still. I
wasn’t straight, Mr. Hudec; I’d already
been in jail for theft, and for another job
besides. Mr. Brych here could tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it wasn’t so bad as all that.” Mr.
Brych dismissed it with a wave of his
hand. “All that you needed was grace.
But there’s some very queer things happen
here, Mr. Hudec, on this spot. But perhaps
you will find it out for yourself. Brother
Kuzenda can give it you properly because he
used to go to meetings before. Look, here
he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone turned towards the opening
leading from the deck to the engine-room.
From the opening there emerged a bearded
face, wearing the forced, embarrassed smile
of one who is being shoved from behind
and is trying to pretend that nothing is
happening. Mr. Kuzenda was visible now
from the waist up, carrying in both hands
a large tin tray on which stood cups and
tins of preserves; he smiled uncertainly as
he rose higher and higher. His feet could
soon be seen on a level with the deck, and
still Mr. Kuzenda and his cups went on rising
in the air. About eighteen inches above
the opening he stopped and began groping
with his feet. There he hung unsupported
in the air, apparently doing his utmost to
get his feet to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hudec was like a man in a dream.
“What is the matter, Mr. Kuzenda?” he
exclaimed, almost in terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, nothing,” Kuzenda replied
evasively, still trying to draw himself down
from the air with his feet; and Mr. Hudec
was reminded of a picture of the Ascension
that in his childhood had hung above his
little cot, and how Our Lord and the Apostles
in precisely the same manner were hanging
in the air and paddling with their feet, but
showing less amazement on their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mr. Kuzenda moved forward
and floated, floated over the deck through
the evening air as though a gentle breeze
might carry him away; now and again he
raised his feet as if he wanted to step out
firmly or something, and he was visibly
concerned for his cups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, come and take this coffee,” he
said hastily. Brych, the stoker, held both
hands up to him and took charge of the
tray and the cups. Then Kuzenda let his
feet hang down, crossed his arms on his
breast, and hung there motionless, with
his head a little on one side, and said,
“Welcome, brothers. Don’t be afraid because
I’m flying. It is only a sign. Will
you take the cup with the flowers on, young
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stoker passed the cups and tins
round. No one dared to speak. Those
who had never been there before gazed in
wonder on the levitation of Kuzenda. The
guests of longer standing sipped their coffee
slowly, and seemed, between the sips, to be
praying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you finished?” asked Kuzenda
after a while, opening wide his colourless,
rapt eyes. “Then I’ll begin.” So saying,
he cleared his throat, meditated for a while,
and began: “In the name of the Father!
Brethren and sisters, on this dredge, where
signs of grace are shown to us, we are
gathered together for worship. We need
not send away the unbelievers and mockers
as the spiritualists do. Mr. Hudec came
as an unbeliever, and the gamekeeper has
been looking forward to a little bit of fun.
You are both welcome; but listen so that
you may see that it is by grace I know you.
You, gamekeeper, drink far too much;
you drive the poor from the forest, and
curse and swear even when there is no
need. Do it no more. And you, Mr.
Hudec, are a better-class thief. You know
very well what I mean. And you’re
shockingly bad-tempered. Faith will reform
and redeem you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Utter stillness reigned on the deck. Mr.
Hudec gazed steadfastly at the floor. The
gamekeeper sobbed and sniffed, and fumbled
with trembling hands for his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what it is, gamekeeper,” said
Kuzenda gently from above. “You’d like
to smoke. Don’t be afraid to light up.
Make yourself quite at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at the little fish,” whispered the
young girl, pointing down to the smooth
surface of the Vltava. “Look, Joe, the
carp have come to listen, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not carp,” came from the
exalted Kuzenda. “They’re perch or dace.
And, Mr. Hudec, you mustn’t worry about
your sins. Look at me: I once cared
for nothing but politics. And I tell you,
that, too, is a sin. There’s no need to
weep, gamekeeper; I didn’t mean to be
hard on you. He who once experiences
grace can see right into men’s hearts. You
can see into people’s souls too, can’t you,
Brych?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can,” said Mr. Brych. “The postman
here is thinking this minute how fine
it would be if you could help his little
daughter. She’s got scrofula, hasn’t she,
postman? Mr. Kuzenda will help her right
enough if you bring her here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s easy to mock and talk about superstition,”
said Kuzenda. “Brothers, if anyone
had told me about miracles and God
before this, I should have laughed at him.
That’s the kind of man I was. When we
got this new machine that runs without fuel
for the dredge, all our dirty heavy work
ceased. Yes, Mr. Hudec, that was the first
miracle that happened here—this Karburator,
that does everything by itself, as though
it had a mind. Even the dredge floats by
itself wherever it ought to go. And look
how steady it is. Do you notice, Mr.
Hudec, that the anchors aren’t down? It
stands still without being anchored, and
floats off again when it’s needed to clear the
river-bed; it starts itself and stops itself.
We, that’s Brych and me, don’t have to
touch a single thing. Will anyone dare tell
me that isn’t a miracle? And when we saw
all this, we began to think it over, didn’t we,
Brych, until it all became clear to us. This
is a sacred dredge, it is an iron church, and
we are only here as its priests. If in old
times God could appear in a well or in
an oak-tree, and sometimes even like a
woman, as with the ancient Greeks, why
should He not appear on a dredge? Why
should He shun machinery? A machine is
often cleaner than a nun, and Brych keeps
everything here as bright and shining as if
it was on a sideboard. However, that’s by
the way. And let me tell you, God is not so
infinite as the Catholics assert. He is about
six hundred metres in diameter, and even then
is weak towards the edges. He is at His
strongest on the dredge. Here He performs
miracles, but on the bank He only does
inspirations and conversions, and in Stechovice,
with a favourable wind, you only notice
a kind of holy fragrance. Not long ago
some oarsmen from the Czech Rowing Club
were paddling by in the <span class='it'>Lightning</span>, close to us,
and grace descended on all of them. Such
is His power. And what this God wishes
us to do, one can only feel here within,”
Kuzenda declared, with an emphatic gesture
towards his heart. “I know that He cannot
bear politics and money, intellect, pride,
and self-conceit. I know He dearly loves
both men and beasts, that He is very glad
when you come here, and that good deeds
are pleasing to Him. He is a thorough
democrat, brethren. We, Brych and me, that
is, feel that every penny burns us until we’ve
bought coffee for everybody. One Sunday
recently, there were several hundred people
here, even sitting on both banks of the river,
and behold, our coffee multiplied itself so
that there was enough for everybody .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
what splendid coffee it was! But such
things, brethren, are only outward appearances.
The greatest miracle is the influence
He has on our feelings. It is so intensely
beautiful that it fairly makes one shiver.
Sometimes you feel as if you could die of
love and happiness, as if you were one with
the water below, with all the animals, with
the very earth and stones, or as if gigantic
arms were holding you embraced; oh,
words cannot utter what you feel. Everything
around you is sounding and singing,
you understand the speech of voiceless things,
the water and the wind, you see deep into
everything, how one thing is linked with
another and with you; at one stroke you
grasp everything better than if you had
read it in print. Sometimes it comes
upon one like a fit, so that one foams at the
mouth; but often it acts quite slowly and
penetrates to one’s tiniest little vein. And
now, brothers and sisters, do not be afraid;
two police officers are just coming across in
a boat to ‘disperse’ us because we are
holding an unauthorized assembly. Just
keep calm and have faith in the God of the
dredge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was already dark; but the entire deck
of the dredge and the faces of those present
were glowing with a tender light. The
splash of oars was heard below the dredge,
then the boat stopped alongside. “Hi,
there!” cried a man’s voice. “Is Mr.
Kuzenda there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he is here,” answered Kuzenda in
the voice of an angel. “Come right up,
brethren of the police. I know that the
innkeeper of Stechovice has laid information
against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two policemen mounted to the deck.
“Which of you is Kuzenda?” asked the
sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, sir,” said Kuzenda, rising higher
in the air. “Kindly come up here to
me, sergeant.” And forthwith both police
officers rose into the air and floated upwards
towards Kuzenda. Their feet groped desperately
for some support, their hands clutched
wildly at the yielding air, and one could hear
their quick and frightened breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be afraid, officers,” said Kuzenda
beatifically, “and say after me this prayer:
O God, our Father, who art incarnate in
this vessel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God, our Father, who art incarnate
in this vessel,” repeated the sergeant in a
choking voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God, our Father, who art incarnate in
this vessel,” Mr. Hudec began in a loud
voice, and he fell on his knees, and on
the deck a chorus of voices mingled with
his own.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>THE CEREMONY</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Cyril Keval</span>, district reporter on the staff of
the Prague <span class='it'>People’s Journal</span>, hurried into
evening-dress for the occasion and dashed
off to Stvanice just after six o’clock in the
evening, to write up the ceremonial opening
of the new Central Karburator Electric
Power Station for Greater Prague. He
shouldered his way through the curious
crowds that overflowed the whole Petrov
quarter, penetrated the three ranks of police,
and reached a small concrete structure
decorated with flags. From inside the little
building could be heard the objurgations of
the workmen, who were, of course, behind
time with the erecting of the machine, and
were now trying to catch up. The whole
Central Power Station was an insignificant
affair, no bigger than a public convenience.
Old Cvancara of the <span class='it'>Venkov</span> was walking
pensively up and down in front of it, looking
somewhat like a meditative heron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my friend,” he said quietly to the
young journalist, “it’s safe to bet on something
happening to-day. I’ve never yet seen
a function where there wasn’t some silly
incident or other. And I’ve been at it
now, young fellow, for forty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is amazing, isn’t it, sir?” Keval
returned. “Fancy this little building lighting
the whole city of Prague and driving
the trams and trains for sixty kilometres
round, besides supplying power for thousands
of factories and—and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cvancara shook his head sceptically.
“We’ll see, my young friend, we’ll see.
Nothing nowadays can surprise any of us of
the old guard, but”—and here Cvancara
lowered his voice to a whisper—“well, just
look round and you’ll see that they haven’t
even got a reserve Karburator handy. Suppose
this one broke down, or even, say,
went up in the air, what then—do you see
what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keval was annoyed at not having thought
of this himself, so he dissented. “That’s
out of the question, sir,” he began. “I
have reliable information. This power
station here is only for show. The real
Central Station is somewhere else; it’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
it’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he whispered, and pointed with
his finger, “right down underground, I
mustn’t say where. Haven’t you noticed,
sir, that they are continually repairing the
streets in Prague?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve been doing it these forty years,”
said Mr. Cvancara gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there you have it,” Keval lied
triumphantly. “Military reasons, you
know. A huge system of underground
passages, storehouses, powder-magazines,
and so on. My information is quite trustworthy.
They’ve got sixteen underground
Karburator fortresses right round Prague.
On the surface there’s not a trace of it, only
football fields, a mineral-water stand, or a
patriotic monument. Ha, ha! Do you see
now? That’s why they’re putting up all
these memorials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young man,” observed Mr. Cvancara,
“what does the present generation know of
war? We could tell them something. Aha,
here comes the Burgomaster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the new Minister for War. You
see, I told you so. The Director of the
Technical Institute. The Chairman of the
M.E.C. The Chief Rabbi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French Ambassador, the Minister
of Public Works. I say, my friend, we’d
better see about getting inside. The Archbishop,
the Italian Ambassador, the President
of the Senate, the Chief of the Sokol
organization; you’ll find that there’s somebody
they’ve left out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Mr. Cyril Keval gave up his
place to a lady, and so was separated from
the doyen of the journalists and lost his
place near the entrance through which the
endless stream of the personages invited was
pouring. Then the strains of the national
anthem were heard, and the orders to the
guard of honour rang out, proclaiming the
arrival of the Chief of State. Accompanied
by a retinue of gentlemen in top-hats and
uniforms, the President advanced along the
crimson carpet towards the little concrete
structure. Mr. Keval stood on tiptoe, confounding
himself and his politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never get in now,” he said to himself.
“Cvancara is right,” he went on ruminating.
“They always do something silly. Fancy
putting up that little hut for an imposing
ceremony like this. Ah well, the Czechoslovak
Press Bureau will supply the speeches,
and one can soon work up the trimmings—deep
impressiveness of the occasion, magnificent
progress, enthusiastic reception for the
President——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden hush within the building made
itself felt outside, and someone began to reel
off the official address. Mr. Keval yawned
and sauntered round the little building with
his hands in his pockets. It was getting
dark. The guards were in full-dress uniform
with white gloves and rubber truncheons.
Crowds of people were standing tightly
packed along the banks. The opening
address was far too long, as usual. Who
was it speaking, anyway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Keval noticed a little window in the
concrete wall of the Central Station about
two metres from the ground. He looked
around, then leapt up like a flash, caught
hold of the grating, and drew his clever head
up to the window. Aha, the speaker was the
Burgomaster of Greater Prague, all red in
the face; beside him stood G. H. Bondy,
Chairman of the M.E.C., representing the
contracting firm, biting his lips. The President
had his hand on the lever of the machine,
ready to press it down at a given signal:
an instant later the festal illuminations of
the whole of Prague would flare out, the
bands would play, the fireworks would begin
to blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Minister of Public Works was turning
and twisting nervously; doubtless he was to
speak when the Burgomaster had finished.
A young Army officer was pulling at his tiny
moustache, the Ambassadors were pretending
to be giving their whole souls to the address,
of which they understood not a single word,
two Trade Union delegates were not moving
an eyelash—in short, “the proceedings
passed off without a hitch,” Mr. Keval said
to himself as he jumped down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then ran five times round the whole
Stvanice district, came back to the Central
Power Station, and again sprang up to the
little window. The Burgomaster was still
speaking. Straining his ears, Keval could
hear “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And then came the disastrous
period of the Battle of the White Mountain.”
He dropped down the wall again quickly, sat
down, and lit a cigar. It was already very
dark. Overhead the little stars twinkled
through the branches of the trees. “It’s
surprising that they didn’t wait until the
President pressed the lever to light up too,”
Keval said to himself. Otherwise, Prague
was in darkness. The black stream of the
Vltava rolled on without a lamp reflected
in its waters. Everything quivered with
expectation of the solemn moment that was
to bring the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Keval had finished his cigar, he
went back to the Power Station and once
more hoisted himself up to the little window.
The Burgomaster was still talking, and his
face was now of a purple bordering on blackness.
The Chief of State was standing with
his hand on the lever, the personages present
were talking together in low tones, only the
foreign Ambassadors listened on unmoving.
At the very back, the head of Mr. Cvancara
could be seen nodding drowsily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sheer physical exhaustion brought the
Burgomaster to an end, and the Minister of
Public Works began speaking. He was obviously
cutting his sentences down unmercifully
to shorten his address. The Chief of
State was now holding the lever in his left
hand. Old Billington, the doyen of the
Diplomatic Corps, had passed away on his
feet, preserving even in death the expression
of an attentive listener. Then the
Minister put an end to his speech as though
with an axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy raised his head, looked about
with heavy eyes, and said a few words,
apparently something to the effect that the
M.E.C. was handing over its work to the
public for the use and benefit of our metropolis,
and so concluded. The Chief of
State drew himself erect and pressed the
lever. Then, in an instant, the whole of
Prague shone out as a vast expanse of light,
the crowds cheered, the bells in all the
steeples began to swing, and from the
Marianske fort there sounded the first boom
of the cannon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still hanging to his grating, Keval looked
around towards the city. Flaming rockets
shot up from Střelecky Island; Hradčany,
Petřín, and even Letna, were aglow with
garlands of electric lamps, distant bands
began competing with each other, illuminated
biplanes circled above Stvanice, while
the immense V16 soared up from Vyšehrad
all bedecked with lanterns. The crowds
removed their hats, the police stood like
statues, their hands raised to their helmets
in salute. Two batteries boomed out from
the bastions, answered by the monitors from
near Karlín.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keval again pressed his face to the bars
to see the conclusion of the ceremonies over
the Karburator taking place inside. The
next instant he uttered a hoarse cry, rolled
his eyes, and once more squeezed himself still
closer to the window. Then he uttered
something like “Oh, God!”, loosened his
hold on the grating, and dropped heavily to
the earth. Before he had actually reached
the ground, someone rushing away from the
place knocked into him. Keval seized him
by the coat, and the man looked round. It
was G. H. Bondy; he was as pale as death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened, sir?” Keval stammered.
“What are they doing in there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go of me,” Bondy panted. “For
Christ’s sake, let go. And get out of here,
as quick as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what has happened to them in
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” shouted Bondy; and knocking
Keval back with his fist, he disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling all over, Keval supported
himself against the trunk of a tree. From
the interior of the concrete building came
sounds as of savages chanting a hymn.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later the Czechoslovak Press
Bureau published the following obscure
statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Contrary to the reports issued by a local publication
which have obtained some currency abroad, we are able
to state on the very best authority that no improper
incidents of any kind took place on the occasion of the
formal opening of the Karburator Central Power Station.
In connection with this, the Burgomaster of Greater Prague
has resigned his office and has gone into the country to
recuperate. Mr. Billington, doyen of the Diplomatic
Corps, is, contrary to published reports, well and active.
The fact is that all present declare that nothing in their
experience has ever made so powerful an impression upon
them. Every citizen has the right to fall to the earth
and worship God, and the performance of miracles is
not in conflict with any official position whatever in a
democratic State. It is in any case decidedly improper
to connect the Chief of State with regrettable incidents
occasioned only by insufficient ventilation, combined with
excessive strain upon the nerves.</span></p>

<h3>SAINT ELLEN</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>A few</span> days after these occurrences G. H.
Bondy was wandering through the streets of
Prague, a cigar between his teeth, thinking
things over. Anyone who met him would
have thought that he was looking at the
pavement; but Mr. Bondy was really looking
into the future. “Marek was right,”
he was saying to himself, “Bishop Linda
even more so. It was simply impossible to
bring God to earth without a confounded
lot coming of it. People could do what they
liked, but it was going to shake the banks
and do goodness knows what with industry.
A religious strike broke out at the Industrial
Bank to-day. We installed a Karburator
there, and within two days the officials
declared the bank’s property to be a sacred
trust for the poor. That couldn’t have
happened when Preis was manager. No, it
certainly would never have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy sucked at his cigar in great depression.
“Well, what about it?” he said to
himself. “Are we to throw the whole thing
up? Orders worth twenty-three millions
came in to-day. It can’t be stopped now.
It means the end of the world, or something.
In two years’ time everything will have come
down crash. There are several thousand
Karburators at work in the world already,
every one of them pouring forth the Absolute
day and night. And this Absolute is
fiendishly clever, too. It has an insane
desire to exert itself, no matter how. There
you are, it hasn’t anything to do, for
thousands of years it’s had nothing to do,
and now we’ve let it off the chain. Just
look at what it’s doing at the Industrial
Bank, for instance. It keeps the bank’s
books all on its own, does the accounts,
carries on the correspondence. It gives
orders to the Board of Directors in writing.
It sends its clients fervent epistles about
showing love by works. What’s the result?
The Industrial Bank shares are mere waste
paper: it would take a kilo of them to buy
a bit of cheese. That’s what happens when
God starts meddling with banking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Oberlander firm, a textile factory in
Upice, is bombarding us with despairing
telegrams. A month ago they put in a
Karburator in place of a boiler. Splendid,
the machines are going strong: all’s well.
But suddenly the spinning-jennies and looms
begin to work all by themselves. When
a thread breaks, it simply splices itself
again, and on they go. The workmen just
look on with their hands in their pockets.
They’re supposed to knock off at six o’clock.
The spinners and weavers go home. But
the looms go running on by themselves.
They go on running all night and all day,
for three whole weeks, weaving, weaving,
weaving without a pause. The firm wires
us: ‘In the devil’s name, take the finished
goods off us, send us raw material, stop the
machines!’ And now it has got hold of
the factory of Buxbaum Brothers, Morawetz
and Co., by sheer long-range infection. There
are no raw materials in the place. They
lose their heads and fling rags, straw, earth,
whatever comes handy, into the machines;
well, even that stuff, if you please, gets woven
into kilometres of towels, calico, cretonne,
and everything imaginable. There’s a
terrific upheaval; the prices of textiles are
coming down with a crash; England is
raising her protective tariff; and our neighbouring
states are threatening us with a
boycott. And the factories are wailing,
‘For the love of Heaven, take the finished
goods away at least. Cart them away; send
us men, lorries, motor trains; stop the
machines!’ In the meantime, they’re suing
us for damages. A damnable life! And
we hear the same thing from all sides, from
everywhere where a Karburator has been
installed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Absolute wants work. It clings
furiously to life. Once it created the earth;
now it has flung itself into manufacture.
It has captured Liberec and the Brno cotton
works, Trutnov, twenty sugar factories, sawmills,
the City Brewery in Pilsen; it
is threatening the Skoda arsenal; it is
busy at Jablonec and in the Jachymov
mines. In many places people are dismissing
their workmen; in others they’ve
taken fright, closed the factories, and
are just letting the machines go ahead
inside. It’s insane over-production. Factories
that haven’t got the Absolute are
stopping production altogether. It’s ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said Mr. Bondy to himself,
“am a patriot. I will not let our country
be brought to ruin. Besides, there are our
own establishments here. Very well, from
to-day onward we will cancel all orders
from Czechoslovakia. What has been done
is done; but from this moment not a single
Karburator shall be set up in the land of the
Czechs. We’ll flood the Germans and the
French with them; then we’ll bombard
England with the Absolute. England is
conservative, and won’t have anything to do
with our Karburators. Well, we’ll drop
them on her from airships like big bombs.
We’ll infect the whole industrial and financial
world with God, and preserve only our own
country as an island of civilization and
honest labour free from God. It is a
patriotic duty, so to speak, and besides, we
have our own factories to consider.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prospect gladdened G. H. Bondy’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate we’ll gain time to invent
some sort of protective mask against the
Absolute. Damn it, I’ll set aside three
millions myself for purposes of research
into protective measures against God.
Better say two millions to start with. All
the Czechs will go about wearing their
masks, while all the rest—ha! ha!—will
be getting drowned in the Absolute. At
any rate their industries will go under.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bondy began to look upon the world
less darkly. “There’s a young woman
going by. Nice springy walk. I wonder
what she looks like from the front.” Mr.
Bondy quickened his step, passed her,
suddenly stepped respectfully to one side,
then seemed to change his mind again,
and turned on his heel so abruptly that he
almost ran right into her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Ellen,” he said hastily. “I had
no idea, that—that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew that you were following me,”
said the girl, standing still with downcast
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew it?” said Bondy, greatly
pleased. “I was just thinking about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could feel your bestial desires,” said
Ellen quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your bestial desires. You did not
recognize me. You only appraised me with
your eyes as if I were for sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy frowned. “Ellen, why do
you wish to hurt my feelings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen shook her head. “They all do it.
They’re all alike, every one of them. One
rarely meets a look that is pure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bondy pursed his lips for a whistle.
Aha, so that’s what it is! Old Machat’s
religious community!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Ellen replied to his thoughts.
“You ought to come and join us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course,” cried Mr. Bondy; and
in his mind he said, “A nice girl like this!
It’s a shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it a shame?” asked Ellen gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, Ellen,” protested Bondy.
“You are a thought-reader. That isn’t
fair. If people were to read each other’s
thoughts they could never decently associate
with one another. It’s very indiscreet of
you to know what I am thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do?” said Ellen. “Everyone
who knows God has this same gift.
Every one of your thoughts is born in my
mind as soon as in yours. I don’t read it,
I have it myself. If you only knew how
purifying it is when one can judge of every
hidden baseness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm,” muttered Mr. Bondy, trembling
lest anything should cross his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed,” Ellen assured him. “It
has cured me, with the help of God, of the love
of riches. I should be ever so glad if the
scales were to fall from your eyes, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid,” exclaimed G. H. Bondy,
horrified. “But tell me, do you understand
everything that you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. see
in people like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then listen to me, Ellen,” said Bondy.
“I can tell you everything, for you’d read
it in me in any case. I could never marry
a woman who would be able to read my
thoughts. She could be religious to her
heart’s content, boundlessly charitable to
the poor; I’m able to afford it, and
besides, it’s good publicity. I’d put up
even with virtue, Ellen, for love of
you. I’d put up with anything. I have
loved you after my fashion, Ellen. I can
tell you so because you can read it for
yourself. But, Ellen, neither business nor
society is possible without thoughts that
are not disclosed. And marriage, above
all things, is impossible without thoughts
that are not disclosed. It is unthinkable,
Ellen. And even if you find the holiest
of men, don’t marry him as long as you can
read his thoughts. A little illusion is the
only bond between mortals that never
breaks. Saint Ellen, you must not marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” said Saint Ellen in soft
tones. “Our God is not opposed to nature;
He only sanctifies it. He does not ask us
to mortify ourselves. He bids us live and
be fruitful. He wants us to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop,” Mr. Bondy interrupted her.
“Your God doesn’t understand. If He
takes away our illusions He is doing something
confoundly opposed to nature. He’s
simply impossible, Ellen, utterly impossible.
If He were a reasonable being, He would
realize it. He’s either wholly inexperienced
or else completely and criminally destructive.
It’s a great pity, Ellen. I haven’t anything
against religion, but this God doesn’t know
what He ought to want. Depart into the
wilderness, Saint Ellen, with your second
sight. You are out of place among us
mortals. Farewell, Ellen; or rather—good-bye
for ever.”</p>

<h3>THE FIRST BLOW STRUCK</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Exactly</span> how it happened has not yet been
established, but just at the very time when the
little factory belonging to R. Marek, Engineer,
1651 Mixa Street, Břevnov, was
garrisoned by detectives and surrounded
by a cordon of police, unknown malefactors
stole the original Marek Karburator. Despite
the most active search, not a trace of the
stolen machine was found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long afterwards Jan Binder, the proprietor
of a merry-go-round, was looking
round the premises of a dealer in old iron
in Hastal Square with a view to purchasing
a little naphtha motor to run his roundabout
and its orchestrion. The dealer offered him a
big copper cylinder with a piston, and said
it was a very economical motor; all one
had to do was to shovel in a little coal, and
it would run for months. Jan Binder was
seized with a strange, almost blind faith in
the copper cylinder, and he bought it for three
hundred crowns. Then he hauled it away on
a truck with his own hands to his merry-go-round,
which was standing out of action
near Zlichov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Binder took off his coat, unloaded the
copper cylinder from the cart, and set to work
whistling softly. He fixed a wheel on the
axle where the fly-wheel used to be, and ran
a belt over this wheel to another axle which
drove the orchestrion with one end and the
merry-go-round with the other. Then he
oiled the bearings, put them into a wheel,
and stood there, in his broad-striped jersey,
with his hands in his pockets, puckering
his lips for a whistle and waiting pensively
to see what would happen next. The wheel
went round three times, then stopped;
presently it quivered, wobbled, and then
began to turn quietly and smoothly. Then
the orchestrion started with all its little
drums and whistles, the merry-go-round gave
itself a shake as if waking from sleep, creaked
in all its joints, and began glidingly to
revolve. The silver fringes gleamed, the
white steeds with their showy trappings and
red bridles seemed to set in motion their
princely equipages, the deer with its wildly
staring eyes swept round, poised as for a
leap, the swans with their elegantly arching
necks drew in a circle their white and sky-blue
vessels; and so all a-glitter, and to
the accompaniment of blaring music, the
merry-go-round rotated its splendours before
the unwinking eyes of the Three Graces
painted on the orchestrion, now carried
away on the rush of its own melodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Binder still stood there with his lips
pursed and his hands in his pockets. He
gazed upon his merry-go-round as though
in a dream, seemingly entranced by something
new and lovely. By this time he was
no longer alone. A tear-stained dirty child
dragged its young nurse up to the merry-go-round
and stopped in front of it with
great round eyes and mouth wide open, rigid
with wonderment. The little nurse, too,
opened wide her eyes and stood there like one
enraptured. The merry-go-round performed
its circuit with a strange resplendence,
sublimity, stateliness, like a festal day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now
whirling round with an impassioned
velocity, now rocking gently like a vessel
laden with the rich perfumes of India, now
floating like a golden cloud high in the
heavens; it seemed to soar upwards, sundered
from the earth, it seemed to sing.
But no, it was the orchestrion that was
singing; now with the joyous voices of
women mingling with a silvery rain of
music falling from harps; and now it was
the roar of a forest or a great organ, but
from the depths of the forest birds fluted
their songs and came and settled on your
shoulders. Golden trumpets proclaimed the
coming of a conqueror or, it might be, a
whole army with flashing fiery swords. And
who was it singing that glorious hymn?
Thousands of people were waving branches
of palm, the heavens opened, and, heralded
by rolling drums, the song of God Himself
descended upon the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Binder raised his hand, but at that
moment the merry-go-round stopped and
leaned towards the little child. The child
tripped on to the merry-go-round as if it
were entering the open gates of Paradise,
and the nursemaid followed as though in a
trance and seated it in one of the boats
drawn by swans. “Free rides to-day!”
said Binder hoarsely; the orchestrion burst
out jubilantly, and the merry-go-round began
to turn as though it would soar up into the
sky. Jan Binder reeled. What could this
mean? Why, it wasn’t the merry-go-round
that was turning now, but the whole earth
that was spinning round and round. The
Zlichovsky Church was describing a gigantic
curve, the Podol Sanatorium and Vyšehrad
were setting off together for the other bank
of the Vltava. Yes, the whole earth was
turning about the merry-go-round, circling
faster and faster, humming like a turbine;
only the merry-go-round stood firm in the
centre, rocking gently like a ship with white
horses, deer, and swans roving about the
deck, and a little child leading its nurse by
the hand and stroking the animals. Yes,
yes, the earth was spinning furiously, and
only the merry-go-round was a lovely island
of quiet and repose. And Jan Binder, dizzy
and sick, raised his arms, and let the mad
earth carry him staggering towards the
merry-go-round, seized one of the rods, and
swung himself up on to its peaceful deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he could clearly see how the earth
was heaving and tossing like a stormy sea.
And look, there were terrified people rushing
out of their houses, waving their hands,
stumbling and falling as though borne along
by a gigantic whirlwind. Holding tightly
to his rod, Binder stooped down to them
and shouted, “Here, people, this way!”
And the people seeing the shining merry-go-round
calmly uplifted above the reeling
earth, staggered towards it. Gripping the
rod, Binder held out his free hand and
pulled them up from the heaving earth:
children, grandmothers, old men, all stood
on the deck of the merry-go-round, taking
breath again after their terrible fright, and
looking down in dismay upon the earth
spinning below them. Binder had just
helped them all up, when a little black puppy
came running by, yelping with fear, and
tried to leap aboard; but the earth carried
him faster and faster round the merry-go-round.
Binder squatted down, reached out
his hand, and grabbed the puppy by the
tail, and lifted it into safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the orchestrion played a song of
thanksgiving. It sounded like a chorus of
survivors of a shipwreck, with the rough
voices of the sailors mingling with the prayers
of children. Over the unleashed tempest
there bent a rainbow of melody (in B minor)
and the heavens opened in the happy
radiance of pizzicati on the violins. The
castaways on Binder’s merry-go-round
stood there silent with their heads bare. The
women’s lips moved softly in silent prayer,
and the children, forgetting the horrors they
had passed through, plucked up courage to
stroke the hard muzzle of the deer and the
supple, neck of the swan. The white horses
patiently allowed the little limbs to clamber
into the saddles; sometimes one of them
neighed or pawed knowingly with his hoof.
The earth was turning more slowly now, and
Jan Binder, a tall figure in his sleeveless
striped jersey, began in his unpractised style
to make a speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good people, here we have
landed out of the whirl and confusion of
the world. Here we have peace amid the
storm. Here we are with God, as safe as in
our beds. It is a sign that we should flee
from the tumult of the world and find refuge
in the arms of God. Amen.” Thus and
in like manner spoke Jan Binder, and the
people on the merry-go-round listened as if
they were in church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the earth stopped spinning, the
orchestrion played a soft and reverent voluntary,
and the people jumped down from the
merry-go-round. Jan Binder told them that
there was no charge, and dismissed them,
converted and uplifted. And when towards
four o’clock the mothers and children and
the old pensioners were taking their afternoon
walk between Zlichov and Smichov,
the orchestrion again began to play, and the
earth once more went flying round, and
again Jan Binder brought everybody safe
on to the deck of the merry-go-round and
calmed them with a suitable address. At
six o’clock people came from their day’s
work, sweethearts emerged at eight, and at
ten the pleasure-seekers left the public-houses
and picture-palaces; all of them in
turn were overcome by the dizzy whirling of
the earth, brought to safety in the embrace
of the merry-go-round, and strengthened
for their future life by the apt exhortations
of Jan Binder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a week of this hallowed work,
Binder’s merry-go-round forsook Zlichov
and went roaming along the bank of the
Vltava up to Chuchle and Zbraslav, and so
reached Stechovice. It had been working
in Stechovice for four days with tremendous
power, when an incident of a somewhat
mysterious character took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Binder had just finished his sermon
and dismissed his new disciples with a
blessing. At that moment there approached
out of the darkness a black and silent body
of people. At their head walked a tall,
bearded man, who went straight up to
Binder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” he said, trying to master
his excitement, “pack up at once, or——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Binder’s adherents heard this and returned
to their teacher. Conscious of having his
people at the back of him, Binder declared
firmly, “Not till it rains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Control yourself, sir,” said another
excited man. “It’s Mr. Kuzenda speaking
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave him to me, Mr. Hudec,” cried
the bearded man. “I’ll soon settle with
him myself. I’m telling you for the second
time; clear out with that thing or, in the
name of the Lord, I’ll smash it up for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as for you,” said Jan Binder, “get
out of here or, in the name of the Lord, I’ll
knock the teeth out of your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God Almighty!” shouted Brych, the
stoker, forcing his way through the crowd to
the front. “Just let him try!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” said Kuzenda soothingly, “let
us first try to settle it quietly. Binder,
you are carrying on foul witchcraft here,
and we’ll not put up with it so close to the
sacred shrine of our dredge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dredge is a fraud!” said Binder
decisively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say?” cried Kuzenda,
cut to the quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dredge is a fraud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened next it is hard to disentangle
into any logical sequence. It seems
that the first blow was struck by the baker
from Kuzenda’s camp, but Binder landed
him a blow on the head with his fist. The
gamekeeper struck Binder on the chest with
his gunstock, but directly afterwards he lost
his gun, and some Stechovice youth from
Binder’s camp used it to knock out Brych’s
front teeth and smash Mr. Hudec’s hat in.
Kuzenda’s postman tried to throttle a youth
on Binder’s side. Binder leaped forward to
help the boy, but a girl from Stechovice
flung herself on him from behind, and bit
him in the arm just where he had had the
Bohemian lion tattooed. One of Binder’s
party drew a knife, and Kuzenda’s followers
seemed to be falling back, but a smaller
group of them dashed on to the merry-go-round
and broke off the deer’s antlers and the
elegantly arching neck of one of the swans.
The merry-go-round gave a deep groan and
heeled over, its roof falling right upon the
struggling mob. Kuzenda was struck by
a pole and knocked unconscious. It all
happened in darkness and silence. When
people came rushing up, Binder had a broken
collar-bone, Kuzenda lay there unconscious,
Brych was spitting out teeth and blood, and
the girl from Stechovice was sobbing hysterically.
The rest had fled.</p>

<h3>DOCTOR BLAHOUS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>That</span> youthful savant Doctor Blahous,
Ph.D., only fifty-five years of age, and now
Lecturer in Comparative Religion at the
University of Prague, rubbed his hands as
he sat down before his quarto sheets of
paper. With a few swift strokes he set
down his title—“Religious Phenomena of
Recent Times”—and began his article with
the words: “The controversy over the
definition of the idea of ‘religion’ has lasted
ever since the days of Cicero”; then he
gave himself up to his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send this article to the <span class='it'>Prague
Times</span>,” he said to himself, “and just you
wait, my revered colleagues, and see what
a stir it will make! It’s lucky for me that
this religious epidemic has broken out just
now! It will make it a very topical little
article. The papers will say, ‘That youthful
savant, Dr. Blahous, has just published
a penetrating study,’ etc. Then I’ll be
given the Assistant Professorship, and old
Regner will burst with fury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the youthful savant rubbed
his wrinkled hands until the bones cracked
blithely, and again began to write. When
towards evening his landlady came to inquire
what he would like for supper, he
was already on the sixtieth page, among the
Fathers of the Church. At eleven o’clock
(and page 115) he had arrived at his own
definition of the idea of religion, which
differed from his predecessor’s by precisely
one word. After this he dealt succinctly
with the methods of the exact science of
religion (with a few shrewd hits at his
opponents), and so brought to an end the
brief introduction to his little article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after midnight our lecturer wrote
the following passage: “It happens that
quite recently various phenomena of a
religious and occult character have occurred
which deserve the attention of the exact
science of religion. Although its main
purpose is undoubtedly to study the religious
customs of nations long since extinct, nevertheless
even the living present can afford the
<span class='it'>modern</span> [Dr. Blahous underlined the word]
student numerous data which <span class='it'>mutatis mutandis</span>
throw a certain light on cults long vanished,
which can only be the subject of conjecture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with the aid of newspaper reports
and evidence given verbally, he gave a
description of Kuzendism, in which he
found traces of fetish-worship and even
totemism (the dredge being made a sort of
Totem God of Stechovice). In the case of
the Binderians, he worked out their relationship
to the Dancing Dervishes and ancient
orgiastic cults. He touched upon the phenomena
witnessed at the opening of the Power
Station, and deftly showed their connection
with the fire-worship of the Parsees. In
Machat’s religious community he discovered
the characteristics of the fakirs and ascetics.
He cited various examples of clairvoyance
and miraculous healing, which he compared
very aptly to the magic practised by the old
negro tribes of Central Africa. He went
on to deal with mental contagion and mass-suggestion,
introducing historical references
to the Flagellants, the Crusades, Millenarianism,
and “running amok” among the
Malays. He threw light upon the recent
religious movement from two psychological
points of view, ascribing it to pathological
cases in degenerate hysterical subjects, and
to a collective psychical epidemic among the
superstitious and mentally inferior masses.
In both cases he demonstrated the atavistic
occurrence of primitive forms of worship,
the tendency to animistic pantheism and
shamanism, a religious communism reminiscent
of the Anabaptists, and a general
surrender of reasoning power in favour of
the grossest impulses of superstition, witchcraft,
occultism, mysticism, and necromancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not for us to decide,” Dr. Blahous
went on writing, “to what extent this is
due to quackery and imposture on the
part of individuals bent on exploiting human
credulity; a scientific inquiry would doubtless
show that the alleged ‘miracles’ of the
thaumaturgists of to-day are only old and
well-known devices of trickery and suggestion.
In this connection we would recommend
the new ‘religious communities,’
sects, and circles now daily springing into
existence to the attention of our police
authorities and psychoanalysts. The exact
science of religion confines itself to establishing
the fact that all these religious
phenomena are at bottom nothing but
examples of barbaric atavism, and a hotchpotch
of the most rudimentary forms of
worship still subconsciously active in the
human imagination. It has only needed a
few fanatics, charlatans, and notorious
swindlers to revive among the peoples of
Europe, under the veneer of civilization,
these prehistoric elements of religious belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Blahous got up from his desk. He
had just finished the three hundredth and
forty-sixth page of his little article, but still
he did not feel weary. “I must think out
an effective finish,” he said to himself;
“some reflections on progress and science,
on the suspicious benevolence of the Government
towards religious heterodoxy, and on
the necessity of presenting a fighting front to
reaction, and so forth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youthful savant, borne on the wings
of his enthusiasm, went to the window and
leaned out into the quiet night. It was
half-past four in the morning. Dr. Blahous
looked out on the dark street, shivering a
little with the cold of the night. Everywhere
was the stillness of death, not a
glimmer of light showed in any human
habitation. The Lecturer raised his eyes
to the sky. It was already paling a little,
but it still shone in its infinite sublimity,
sown with stars. “How long it is since I
looked at the sky!” came suddenly into the
scholar’s mind. “Good heavens, it is more
than thirty years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he felt a delicious coolness
about his brow, as though someone had
taken his head in cool and spotless hands.
“I’m so lonely,” the old man sighed, “so
terribly lonely all the time! Yes, stroke
my hair a little. Alas, it is thirty long years
since anyone’s hand was laid upon my
brow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Blahous stood there in the window,
stiff and shaking. “There is something
here all about me,” he suddenly perceived
with a sweet and overwhelming emotion.
“Dear God, I am not alone after all!
Someone’s arm is around me, someone is
beside me; oh, if he would only stay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If his landlady had entered the room a
little later, she would have seen him standing
in the window with both arms raised on
high, his head flung back, and an expression
of the utmost rapture on his face. But
then he shuddered, opened his eyes, and as
if in a dream went back to his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the other hand, however, it is
impossible to doubt,” he wrote rapidly,
heedless of all that he had already written,
“that God cannot now reveal Himself
otherwise than in primitive forms of worship.
With the decay of faith in modern times our
connection with the old religious life has
been broken. To bring us back to Him,
God must begin again from the beginning
and do as He did with the savages in olden
times: at first He is an idol, a fetish; the
idol of a group, a clan or a tribe; He animates
all nature and works through a witchdoctor.
This evolution of religion is being
repeated before our eyes, beginning with its
prehistoric forms and working upwards to
the loftier types. It is possible that the
present religious wave will divide into several
streams, each striving for supremacy to the
disadvantage of the others. We must expect
an era of religious struggles which will
surpass the Crusades in their fury and
obstinacy and the last World Wars in their
scope. In our godless world the Kingdom
of Heaven cannot be established without
great sacrifices and confusion of doctrine.
Nevertheless I say unto you: Give yourself
up with your whole beings to the Absolute;
believe in God, in whatsoever form He may
declare Himself to you. Behold even now
He cometh to set up on our earth, and
perchance on other planets of our system
also, the everlasting Empire of God, the
Czardom of the Absolute. Ere it is too
late, I say yet again unto you: Humble
yourselves before Him!”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>This article by Dr. Blahous did actually
appear. Not in its entirety, to be sure.
The editor published part of his discussion
of the new sects and the whole
of his conclusion, with a cautious note to
the effect that this paper by the youthful
savant was certainly characteristic of our
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blahous’s article did not cause any stir,
for it was overshadowed by other events.
Only that youthful savant, Dr. Regner, Lecturer
in Philosophy, read it with immense
interest, and afterwards proclaimed in various
places: “Blahous is impossible. Utterly
impossible. How on earth can a man have
the nerve to pose as an expert on religion
when he actually believes in God?”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE CHRONICLER’S APOLOGY</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>And</span> now permit the chronicler of the
Absolute to call your attention to his painful
situation. First of all, he is in the act of
writing Chapter XIII, well aware that this
unlucky number will have a fatal influence
on the clarity and completeness of his
exposition. There is going to be a mix-up
of some kind in this unfortunate chapter,
you may be sure. Of course, the author
could quite calmly head it Chapter XIV,
but the observant reader would feel that he
had been cheated out of Chapter XIII, and
no one could blame him, since he has paid
to have the whole narrative. Besides, if you
are afraid of the number thirteen, you
have only to skip this chapter. It will
certainly not cause you to lose much light
on the obscure affair of the Factory for the
Absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the other embarrassments of the
chronicler are much more serious. He has
described as coherently as he could the
origin of the factory and its prosperity. He
has called your attention to the occurrences
due to certain of the Karburator cylinders
in Mr. Machat’s buildings, at the Zivno
Industrial Bank, in the textile works at
Upice, aboard Kuzenda’s dredge, and on
Binder’s merry-go-round. He has described
the tragic experience of Blahous, the result
of long-range infection, induced by the free
and mobile Absolute, which had evidently
begun to spread in a serious fashion, although
after no definite plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now you must remember that since
the beginning of the whole affair countless
thousands of Karburators of the most diverse
types had been manufactured. Trains, flying-machines,
automobiles, and ships driven by
this most economical of all motors discharged
along their routes whole clouds of the
Absolute, just as in other days they used to
leave a trail of dust, smoke, and smells.
You must remember that thousands of
factories all over the world had already
scrapped their old boilers and equipped
themselves with Karburators; that hundreds
of Government departments and offices,
hundreds of banks, exchanges, wholesale and
export firms, as well as huge restaurants,
hotels, military barracks, schools, theatres,
tenements, thousands of newspaper offices
and clubs, cabarets, and households were
being heated by the latest M.E.C. Central-Heating
Karburator. You must remember
that the Stinnes interests with all their
ramifications had amalgamated with the
M.E.C., and that the American Ford works
had flung themselves into mass-production
which hurled thirty thousand finished Karburators
out upon the world every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, bearing all this in mind, just recall
what happened with each of those Karburators
whose history has been presented
to you. Multiply these incidents a hundred
thousand times, and you will grasp at once
the unhappy position of the present chronicler.
How gladly he would journey with
you after each new Karburator, see it loaded
on the wagon, and offer a bit of hay or
bread or a lump of sugar to the heavy
draught-horses, with their broad and kingly
backs, which drag the new copper cylinders
on the rattling lorry to the factory! How
gladly he would look on while they set it
up, standing with his hands behind his
back and giving the erectors his advice,
and then wait until it was set in motion!
How eagerly then he would peer into people’s
faces to note when “it” would begin to
affect them, when the Absolute would creep
into their being by the nose or ears or any
other part, and begin to dissolve the hardness
of their nature, overpower their personal
tendencies, and cure their moral wounds; to
watch the Absolute turn them up with its
heavy plough, warm them, master them, and
shape them anew; to see it lay open to them
a world so marvellous and yet intrinsically
so human, of wonders, ecstasy, enlightenment,
inspiration and belief! For you
must know that the chronicler, admits
that he is incapable of writing a history.
Where the historian uses the press or
pounder of his historical learning, documentary
lore, abstracts, synthesis, statistics,
and other professional devices, to squeeze
thousands and hundreds of thousands of
little vital personal incidents into a dense
and arbitrary conglomerate known as “a
historical fact,” “a social phenomenon,”
“a mass movement,” “evolution,” “the
mind of the race,” or “historical truth”
in general, the chronicler sees only the individual
cases and even finds them pleasing
in themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now suppose that he had to describe and
explain, say, pragmatically, progressively,
theoretically, and synthetically, the “religious
wave” which swept over the whole world
before the year 1950. Once he sees this
grandiose task before him, he begins collecting
the “religious phenomena” of his own
time; and there, in the course of these
researches, he comes, for example, upon
Jan Binder, ex-variety artiste, wandering
from place to place in his striped jersey with
his atomic merry-go-round. Historical synthesis,
of course, requires the chronicler to
omit the striped jersey, the merry-go-round,
even Jan Binder himself, and retain as the
“historical nucleus,” or scientific result, only
the discovery that “these religious phenomena
from the very outset affected the most
diverse classes of society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, the chronicler must here
and now confess that he cannot cast aside
Jan Binder, that he is fascinated by his
merry-go-round, and that even that striped
jersey of his interests him far more than
any “synthetic outline” whatever. To
be sure, this displays complete scientific
incompetence, empty dilettantism, the
narrowest historical outlook, or anything
else you like; yet if the chronicler could
give rein to his personal inclinations, he
would go off on his travels with Jan
Binder as far as Budejovice, then to Klatovy,
Pilsen, Zlutice, and so on. It is with regret
that he leaves him in Stechovice and waves
his hand and cries, “Good-bye, Binder,
you sturdy fellow, and good-bye, merry-go-round!
We shall never meet again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bless my soul, it was with just the same
feeling that I left Kuzenda and Brych on
the Vltava dredge. I should have liked to
spend many and many an evening with
them, for I love the Vltava and all running
water in general, and evenings on the water
in particular, and I took an unusual liking
to Mr. Kuzenda and Mr. Brych as well.
As for Mr. Hudec, the baker, the postman,
the gamekeeper, and the sweethearts from
Stechovice, I believe that they, too, would
be worth knowing intimately, as anyone is,
as all of you are, as is every living human
being. But I must push on, and I have
hardly time enough to wave my hat to you.
Good-bye, Mr. Kuzenda; good-night, Mr.
Brych. My thanks for that one evening on
board the dredge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of you, too, Dr. Blahous, I must take
my leave. I should like to spend many a
year with you and describe your whole
career .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for is not the life of a university
lecturer rich and exciting, after its fashion?
Give my regards to your landlady at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything there is, is worth observing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that is why I should like to accompany
each new Karburator on its way. I should
become acquainted with fresh people every
day, and so would you, and that is always
worth while. Just to peep through one’s
spyglass into their lives, to see their hearts,
to watch their personal faith and personal
salvation come into being, to linger amid the
new marvels of human saintliness—that is
what would lure me on! Just picture to
yourself a beggar, a ruling chief, a bank-manager,
an engine-driver, a waiter, a rabbi,
a major, a writer on political economy, a
cabaret comedian, men of every possible
calling; and imagine a miser, a sensualist,
a glutton, a sceptic, a hypocrite, a sneak,
a career-hunter, men of every possible
human passion—what diverse, endlessly
varying, strange and surprising instances
and phenomena of heavenly grace (or, if you
like, poisoning with the Absolute) one could
meet, and how absorbing it would be to
study each one of them. What gradations
of faith there would be, from the ordinary
believer to the fanatic, from the penitent to
the miracle-worker, from the convert to the
fiery apostle. If one could only embrace it
all! If one could only extend a hand to
each of them! But it is useless; that
great work will never be completed, and the
chronicler, having renounced the honour of
distilling scientifically all his historical
material, turns away with sorrow from the
individual cases which it is not permitted
him to relate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish I could stay a little longer with
Saint Ellen! I wish I need not treacherously
abandon our friend R. Marek, undergoing
a rest cure at Spindelmühl! I wish
I could reveal the workings of the brain of
that industrial strategist, G. H. Bondy. All
in vain; the Absolute has already flooded
the world, and has become a mass-phenomenon;
and the chronicler, regretfully looking
backward, must reconcile himself to a
summary description of a few of the social
and political events which inevitably ensued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Come, then, let us enter upon a new
range of facts.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<h3>THE LAND OF PLENTY</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> has often happened to the chronicler (and
surely to many of his readers) that when for
any reason whatever he has gazed at the
night sky and the stars, and realized with mute
amazement their prodigious number and
their inconceivable distance and dimensions,
and told himself that each of those glittering
dots was a gigantic flaming world or a whole
living planetary system, and that there were
possibly billions, say, of such dots; or when
he has looked down to a far horizon from
a high mountain (it happened to me in the
Tatras), and has seen beneath him fields and
woods and mountains, and right in front of
him dense forest and grass lands, all of it
more than luxuriant, running riot, life
exuberant and alarming in its richness—and
when he has noted in the grass myriads
of blossoms, tiny beetles, and butterflies, and
has mentally multiplied this mad profusion
by the vast expanses stretching away before
him to Heaven knows where, and has added
to these expanses the millions of other
expanses equally crowded and luxuriant,
which compose the surface of our earth; at
such a moment it has often happened that
the chronicler has bethought him of the
Creator, and has said to himself: “If someone
made or created all this, then we must
admit that it is a terrible waste. If anyone
wanted to show his power as a Creator, there
was no need to create such an insane quantity
of things. Excess is chaos, and chaos is
something like insanity or drunkenness.
Yes, the human intellect is staggered by the
over-profusion of this creative achievement.
There is simply <span class='it'>too much</span> of it. It’s boundlessness
gone mad. Of course, He who is
Infinite from His very birth is accustomed to
huge proportions in everything, and has no
proper standard (for every standard implies
finiteness) or, rather, has no standard whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I beg you not to regard this as blasphemy;
I am only endeavouring to set forth the disproportion
between human ideas and this
cosmic superabundance. This wanton, purposeless,
well-nigh feverish excess of everything
that exists appears to the sober human
eye more like creativeness run wild than
conscientious and methodical creation. That
is what I wish to say, with all due respect,
before we return to our story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You are already aware that the process
of perfect combustion invented by Marek
practically proved the presence of the Absolute
in every form of matter. One might
put it this way (only as a hypothesis, of
course), that before the creation of all things
the Absolute existed in the form of an
Infinite Free Energy. For some cogent
physical or moral reason, this Free Energy
began to be creative. It became Working
Energy, and following the laws of inversion,
it was transformed into a state of Infinite
Imprisoned Energy. It lost itself somehow
in its own handiwork, i.e. in created matter,
and remained there latent, as if under a spell.
And if this is hard to understand, I cannot
help you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, apparently as a result of the
perfect combustion effected by Marek’s
atomic motors, this imprisoned energy was
liberated, freed of the fetters of matter which
had held it fast. It became once more
Free Energy or active Absolute, as free as
it was before the Creation. It was the
sudden release of that same inscrutable
and unresting power which had already
manifested itself once in the Creation of the
World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the whole cosmos at once were to
undergo complete combustion, the first act
of creation might be repeated; for that
would indeed be the end of the world, a
complete liquidation which would make
possible the establishment of a new world-firm,
Cosmos the Second. Meanwhile, as
you know, Marek’s Karburators were only
burning up the material world by kilogrammes
at a time. Being thus released in
small quantities only, the Absolute either
did not feel sufficiently strong to begin
creating again at once, or perhaps did not
wish to repeat itself. Anyhow, it decided
to express itself in two ways, one of them to
some extent traditional and the other
distinctly modern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The traditional manner in which it began
to exert itself was, as you already know, the
religious one. This embraced all varieties
of illumination, conversion, moral effects,
miracles, levitations, ecstasies, predictions,
and, above all, religious faith. Here the
Absolute burst into the personal and social
life of the people over paths already well
trodden, but to an extent hitherto unheard
of. After a few months of its activity there
was practically not a single person on earth
who had not experienced, if only for a
moment, that religious shock by which the
Absolute made known its presence to his
soul. We will return to the subject of this
psychological onset of the Absolute later
on, when it will be necessary to depict its
catastrophic consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other form of manifestation of the
existence of the Absolute at large was something
entirely new. The Infinite Energy
which had once busied itself with the
creation of the world apparently took cognizance
of the altered conditions, and flung
itself into manufacture. It did not form
something out of nothing, but it made
finished goods out of raw material. Instead
of indulging in pure creation, it took its
place at the machines. It became the
Infinite Artisan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suppose that some factory or other, say
a place where tacks were manufactured, had
installed a Perfect Karburator in place of a
steam-engine as the cheapest form of plant.
The Absolute constantly emanating from
the atomic motor learnt the whole process
of manufacture in a single day, by virtue of
its innate intelligence, and flung itself with
all its uncontrollable energy or, perhaps,
ambition into this occupation. It began to
manufacture tacks on its own account.
Once it started, nothing could stop it.
Without anyone in control of it, the machine
vomited forth tacks. The supplies of iron
ready to be manufactured into tacks raised
themselves of their own accord, one piece
after another, thrust themselves through the
air, and inserted themselves in the proper
machines. It was at first an uncanny thing
to see. When these supplies were exhausted
iron sprouted out of the earth, the ground
round about the factory exuded pure iron
as if it were being drawn by suction from
the depths of the earth. This iron then
raised itself into the air to the height of
about one metre and slid jerkily into the
machinery <span class='it'>as if it were being pushed in</span>.
Please note this carefully; I may have said
“the iron raised itself” or “the iron slid,”
but all eye-witnesses give it as their impression
that the iron was <span class='it'>lifted</span> by sheer force
by an inexorable but invisible power, and
with a might so manifest and concentrated
that they were seized with horror. It was
plain to the eye that it was being done by
the exercise of <span class='it'>terrific effort</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably some of you have toyed with
spiritualism and have seen something of
“table-lifting.” If so, you will bear me out
in this—that the table certainly did not rise
as though it had lost its material weight,
but rather moved with a sort of spasmodic
effort; it creaked in all its joints, and
quivered, and fairly reared, until finally it
leaped up in the air as if lifted by a power
which was struggling with it for mastery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how am I to describe the frightful,
silent struggle which forced iron to raise
itself from the depths of the earth, which
pressed it into bars, threw these into the
machines, and smashed them up into tacks?
The bars twisted like withies, fought against
the motion that pushed them forward, rattled
and grated amid the silence of that which
wrestled with them, soundless and substanceless.
All contemporary reports speak
of the horror of the scene. It was a very
miracle, but do not imagine that a miracle
is something fabulously easy and effortless;
it rather seems that the performance of a
genuine miracle entails intense and exhausting
exertions. But though the labours of
the Absolute might make a great call upon
its powers, the most astounding thing about
its new activities was the copiousness of its
output. Thus, to keep to the department
already mentioned, the one solitary tack
factory which the Absolute had in its power
poured forth night and day so many tacks
that they were piled up in mountains in the
yard, and eventually broke down the fences
and blocked up the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us stick to this instance of the tacks
for the time being. It shows you the whole
nature of the Absolute, just as inexhaustible
and extravagant as it was at the time of the
Creation. Once it had thrown itself into
production, it did not trouble about distribution,
consumption, market, or ultimate
object; it did not trouble about anything:
it simply devoted its gigantic energy to
pouring forth tacks. Being itself infinite in
essence, it knew neither measure nor limitation
in anything, even in the matter of tacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can well imagine how the workmen
in such a factory were startled by the performances
of the new motive power. For
them it was a case of wholly unexpected and
unfair competition, something that made
their labour altogether superfluous; and
they would quite rightly have protected
themselves against this assault of the capitalism
of the Manchester School on the working
classes by at least demolishing the factory
and hanging its proprietors, if the Absolute
had not surprised and overpowered them by
its first method of attack, religious illumination
of every form and degree. Meantime
they experienced levitations, prophecies,
miracle-working, visions, supernatural cures,
sanctification, love for their neighbours, and
other conditions equally unnatural, not to say
miraculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, you can easily guess
how the proprietor of such a tack-factory
would greet this divine mass-production.
He might certainly rejoice, discharge all his
workmen, with whom he was in any case
well-nigh worried to death, and rub his
hands over the volcanic gush of tacks which
it cost not a penny to produce. But on
the one hand, he himself was sure to fall
a victim to the psychic effects of the
Absolute, and hand over the whole factory
on the spot to his workmen, his brothers in
God, as their common property; while on
the other hand he very soon realized that
those mountains of tacks were utterly valueless
because he would find no market for
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that the workmen no longer
had to stand at the machines and carry bars
of iron, and were part-proprietors of the
factory besides. But in a few days’ time it
became evident that it was necessary to get
rid, somehow or other, of the hundred-ton
mountains of tacks which had ceased to be
saleable goods. At first some attempts were
made to send the tacks off in wagon-loads
to imaginary addresses; later on, there was
nothing for it but to cart them off to huge
dumps outside the city. This removal of
the tacks kept all the workmen busy for a
full fourteen hours a day, but they did not
grumble, being illuminated by the divine
spirit of love and of mutual service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forgive me for spending so much time
over these tacks. The Absolute was ignorant
of industrial specialization. It invaded the
spinning-mills with equal ardour, and there
not only performed the miracle of making
sand into ropes, but even spun it into
thread. In the weaving and fulling mills
and in the stocking factories it laid hold on
the entire textile department, and reeled off
without pause millions of kilometres of
everything that can be cut with scissors. It
took possession of the iron works, the rolling
mills, the foundries, the factories for agricultural
machinery, the sawmills, timber works,
rubber works, sugar-mills, chemical works,
fertilizer works, nitrogen and naphtha plants,
printing works, paper-mills, dye works,
glass works, potteries, boot and shoe factories,
ribbon works, forges, mines, breweries,
distilleries, creameries, flour-mills, mints,
motor works, and grinding plants. It wove,
spun, knitted, forged, cast, erected, sewed,
planed, cut, dug, burned, printed, bleached,
refined, cooked, filtered, and pressed for
twenty-four to twenty-six hours a day.
Harnessed to agricultural machines in the
place of tractors, it ploughed, sowed, harrowed,
weeded, cut, harvested and threshed.
In every department it augmented the raw
material and multiplied the output hundreds
of times. It was inexhaustible. It simply
squandered its activity. It had found a
quantitative expression for its own infinitude:
over-production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miraculous multiplication of the
loaves and fishes in the desert was repeated
on a colossal scale in the miraculous multiplication
of tacks, boards, nitrates, pneumatic
tyres, rolls of paper, and manufactured
articles of every kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus there ruled in the world a state of
boundless plenty of all that men could need.
But men need everything, everything but
boundless plenty.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<h3>DISASTER</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> course, in our own orderly and (one
might well say) blessed times of general
scarcity, we simply cannot imagine the social
evil that boundless plenty could be. To us
it seems that to find ourselves all of a sudden
amid unlimited supplies of everything we
wanted would be nothing short of the
Earthly Paradise. It would be all to the
good, we think; there would be enough of
everything for everybody—and Lord! how
prices would come down!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, the economic catastrophe
which befell the whole world at the period
we are describing, as a result of the interference
of the Absolute in industry, arose
from the fact that people could get everything
they wanted, not merely at a low price,
but simply for nothing. You might help
yourself, free of charge, to a handful of tacks,
to go into your boot-soles or into the floor;
you could just as easily help yourself to a
whole cartload of tacks gratis—only I ask
you, what would you do with them? Would
you haul them a hundred kilometres off and
then give them away? You wouldn’t do
that; for when you stood before that
avalanche of tacks, what you saw was not
tacks—relatively useful objects—but something
perfectly valueless and senseless in its
profusion, something as purposeless as are
the stars in the sky. Of course, such a
mound of new and shining tacks was often
an uplifting sight, and even inspired poetical
reflections as do the stars in the sky. They
seemed created to be gazed upon in silent
wonder. It was a fine sight in its way, as
a piece of landscape, just as the sea is from
that point of view. But then again, you
don’t take the sea away in carts into the
interior of the country where there is no
sea. There is no economic distribution for
sea-water—and now there was none for
tacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while in one place there spread this
sparkling ocean of tacks, in another only a
few kilometres farther off there was not a
tack to be had. Having become economically
worthless, they had disappeared from
the shops. If anyone wished to knock one
into his shoe or put one into his neighbour’s
mattress, he sought for it in vain. There
weren’t any, just as there is no sea at
Slaný or Caslav. Where were you then,
you business men of days gone by, who
used to buy the necessities of life so cheap
in one place and sell them so dear in
another? Alas, you had vanished, for
heavenly grace had descended upon you.
You had grown ashamed of your gains;
you had shut up your shops to reflect upon
the brotherhood of man; you had given
away your possessions, and never again
would you desire to enrich yourselves by
the distribution of those things which are
needed by all your brethren in God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No value means no market. No market
means no distribution. No distribution
means no goods. And no goods means
greater demand, higher prices, bigger profits
and larger businesses. And you had
turned your backs upon gain, and conceived
an uncontrollable antipathy to all figures
whatsoever. You had ceased to look upon
the material world with the eyes of consumption,
market, and sale. You stood with
clasped hands staring at the beauty and the
profusion of the world. And in the meanwhile
the supply of tacks ran out. At last
none remained. Only somewhere, far away,
they were piled up as by an inexhaustible
avalanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even you, ye master bakers, went out in
front of your shops, and cried, “Come
then, children of God, in the name of Christ,
our Master, come and take these loaves and
flour and biscuits and rolls. Have pity on
us and take them for nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And you, ye drapers, brought your bales of
cloth and rolls of linen out into the street,
and wept with joy as you cut off five or ten
metre lengths for everyone who went by,
and begged them for the love of God to
accept your little gift; and only when your
shop was completely empty of its wares did
you fall on your knees and thank God that
He had given you the opportunity to clothe
your neighbours as He clothes the lilies in
the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And you, ye butchers and dealers in
cooked meats, you took baskets of meat
and sausages and polonies on your heads,
and went from door to door, and knocked
or rang, and begged everybody just to help
themselves to whatever they fancied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all you who sell boots, furniture,
tobacco, bags, spectacles, jewels, carpets,
whips, ropes, tinware, china, books, false
teeth, vegetables, medicines, or whatever
else one can think of—all of you, touched
by the breath of God, poured out into the
street, a prey to the generous panic born
of grace divine, and gave away all you
possessed; after which, either coming
together or standing on the threshold of
your emptied shops and warehouses, you
declared to one another with glowing eyes,
“Now, brother, I have eased my conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few days it became evident that there
was nothing left to give away. But there
was also nothing left to buy. The Absolute
had pillaged and completely cleaned out
every place of business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, far away from the cities,
there poured from the machines millions
of metres of wool and linen, Niagaras of
lump sugar, all the teeming, magnificent
and inexhaustible profusion of the divine
over-production of every kind of goods.
Some feeble efforts to divide and distribute
this flood of commodities were quelled at
the outset. It simply could not be mastered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For that matter, it is possible that this
economic catastrophe had also another cause:
currency inflation. You see, the Absolute
had likewise taken possession of the Government
mints and printing establishments, and
every day it flung out upon the world
hundreds of millions of banknotes, coins,
and securities. Utter devaluation was the
result: before long a packet of five thousand
mark notes meant nothing more than so
much waste-paper. Whether you offered
a halfpenny or half a million for a child’s
lollypop, it was all the same from the business
point of view: you wouldn’t get
the lollypop, anyhow, for they had all
disappeared. Figures had lost all significance.
This collapse of the numerical
system is, in any case, the natural consequence
of the infinitude and omnipotence
of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, food shortage and even
famine had already made themselves felt in
the cities. The organization for the maintenance
of supplies had broken down completely
for the reasons just mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course there were Ministries of Supply,
Commerce, Social Welfare, and Railways,
and by our ideas it should have been possible
to get control of the gigantic stream of
factory production in time, prevent the goods
from spoiling, and transport them carefully
to the places which the liberality of the
Absolute had despoiled. Unhappily this
plan was not followed. The personnel of
each of the Ministries were the victims of
grace in unusual power, and spent their
office hours in joyful prayer. In the Ministry
of Supply a lady clerk named Sarova controlled
the situation, preaching on the
subject of the Seven Degrees; in the
Ministry of Commerce the head of a department,
Mr. Winkler, proclaimed a severe
asceticism which resembled the teachings
of the Hindu Yoga. True, this excessive
zeal lasted only a fortnight, being succeeded
(doubtless through special inspiration from
the Absolute) by a period of extraordinary
devotion to duty. The departments responsible
worked feverishly day and night
to avert a breakdown of food supplies, but
apparently it was even then too late. The
only result was that each department produced
daily from fifteen to fifty-three
thousand bills and enactments, which by
decree of the Inter-Ministerial Commission
were carted away daily on motor lorries to
the Vltava River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The food situation assuredly offered the
most terrible problem. Luckily, however,
there remained (I am, of course, describing
conditions only in our own country) <span class='sc'>Our
Jolly Farmers</span>. And here, gentlemen, you
must learn that from time immemorial we
have had the saying: “With all due respect
to anyone else, our countryfolk are the
backbone of the nation.” In fact, there’s
an old rhyme about it, something like this:
“Who is the man so strong and tall, Whose
daily labour feeds us all? The farmer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was the man with whom the feverish
prodigality of the Absolute came to a halt;
who was the man who stood unmoved amid
the panic of the markets of the world;
who was the man who did not fold his
hands in his lap, who did not let himself
be carried off his feet, but “remained
faithful to the law of his being”? Who
was the man so strong and tall whose daily
labour fed us all? The farmer!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it was the farmer (and the same thing
happened elsewhere), who by his conduct
saved the world from starvation. Just
imagine the consequences if he had been
seized, like the townsfolk, with the mania
for giving everything away to the poor and
needy; if he had given away all his corn,
his cows and calves, his chickens and geese
and potatoes. Within a fortnight famine
would have stalked through the cities, and
the countryfolk themselves would have
been sucked dry, starved out, left stripped
of all their supplies. Thanks to our sturdy
farmer, this was not to be. Whether you
explain it after the event, as being due to
the marvellous instinct of the country-dweller,
or to his steadfast, pure, deep-rooted
tradition, or finally to the fact that in the
rural districts the Absolute was less potent,
because in the small agricultural holdings
the Karburator was not so widely used as
in industry—in short, explain it as you
please, the fact remains that amid the
general collapse of the economic and financial
structure, and of the whole market, <span class='it'>the
farmer gave nothing away</span>. He did not give
away even a wisp of straw or a grain of oats.
Calm and unmoved amid the ruins of the
old industrial and commercial order, our
farmer went on selling what he had. And
he sold it dear. He sensed through some
mysterious instinct the calamitous significance
of over-production, and so he put on
the brakes in time. He did this by raising
his prices, however crammed his granaries
might be. And it is a testimony to the
amazing soundness of the core of our
countryfolk that without saying a word to
each other, without any organization, led
only by the redeeming inward voice, they
raised their prices everywhere and for everything.
By thus putting up the price of
everything, the farmer saved it from destruction.
In the midst of insensate profusion
he preserved an island of scarcity
and costliness. He foresaw, of a surety,
that thereby he was saving the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For while other goods, being made valueless
by being given away gratis, vanished
from the market at once as a natural result,
foodstuffs continued to be sold. Of course
you had to go out into the country to fetch
them. The baker and butcher and retailer
had nothing they could give you except
brotherly love and pious words. So you
took up your knapsack and went a hundred
and twenty kilometres out. You went from
farm to farm, and in one place you bought
a kilo of potatoes in exchange for a gold
watch, in another an egg for a pair of opera-glasses,
in another a kilo of bran for a
harmonium or a typewriter. And so you had
something to eat. You see, if the farmer
had given it all away, you would have been
done for long ago. But the farmer saved
even a pound of butter for you—of course
only in order to dispose of it for a Persian
rug or a costly national costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, who brought the mad communistic
experiments of the Absolute to a halt?
Who did not lose his head amid the epidemic
of righteousness? Who withstood the disastrous
tide of superabundance and saved us
from destruction without sparing our persons
or our purses?</p>

<h3>IN THE MOUNTAINS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was noon at the Hut in Bear Valley.
Rudolf Marek sat curled up on the veranda;
he looked at a newspaper, but he soon folded
it up again, and gazed out over the far-stretching
chain of the Giant Mountains.
Stillness, a vast and crystalline stillness, lay
upon the mountains, and the man curled up
in the chair straightened himself and took
a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the tiny figure of a man appeared
from below, making towards the Hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How pure the air is here!” thought
Marek on his veranda. “Here, Heaven
be praised, the Absolute is still latent, it
still lies under a spell, hidden in everything,
in these mountains and forests, in the sweet
grass and the blue sky. Here it does not
rush about all over the place, waking terror
or working magic; it simply dwells in all
matter, a God deeply and quietly present,
not even breathing, only in silence watching
over all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Marek clasped his hands
in a mute prayer of thankfulness. “Dear
God, how pure the air is here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who had come up from below
stopped under the veranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Marek, so I’ve found you at
last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek looked up, not greatly pleased.
The man who stood before him was G. H.
Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’ve found you at last!” Bondy said
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along up, then,” said Marek,
with obvious reluctance. “What the deuce
has brought you here? Heavens, man, you
do look queer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy did indeed look sunken and
yellow; he had gone very grey about the
temples, and lines of weariness made dark
shadows around his eyes. He seated himself
without a word beside Marek and
squeezed his hands together between his
knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, what’s wrong with you?”
Marek pressed him after a painful silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy raised his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to retire, old man. You
see, it’s got me too .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>me</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, religion?” shouted Marek, recoiling
as though from a leper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy nodded. Was it not a tear of
shame that trembled on his lashes? Marek
whistled softly. “What—it’s got you now?
My poor old fellow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” cried Bondy quickly, wiping his
eyes. “Don’t think I’m not all right at
present; I’ve got it under, you might say,
Rudy, I’ve beaten it. But, do you know,
when it came over me, it was the very
happiest moment of my life. You have no
idea, Rudy, what tremendous will-power it
takes to shake <span class='it'>that</span> off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can well believe it,” said Marek
gravely. “And tell me, what sort of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. symptoms did you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love for my neighbour,” Bondy whispered.
“Man, I was frantic with love. I
would never have believed it possible to
feel anything like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, then, you’ve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Marek began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thrown it off. Rather like a fox that
gnaws its own leg off when it’s caught in
a trap. But I’m still confoundedly weak
after the struggle. An utter wreck, Rudy.
As if I’d had typhoid. That’s why I’ve
come here, to pick up again, you see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Is it all clear up here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite clear; not a single trace of it
so far. You can only sense it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in
Nature and everything; but then one could
do that before—one always could, in the
mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy kept a gloomy silence. “Well,
and what do you make of it all?” he said
absently, after a while. “Have you any
notion up here of what’s going on down
below there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I get the papers. Even from the papers
one can to a certain extent deduce what is
happening. Of course these journalists
distort everything; still, anyone who can
read .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say, Bondy, are things really
so awful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. H. Bondy shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot worse than you think. Simply
desperate. Listen,” he whispered brokenly.
“He’s everywhere by now. I think that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that He’s got a definite plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A plan?” cried Marek, leaping to his
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t shout so. He has some kind of
plan, my friend. And He’s going about
it deuced cleverly. Tell me, Marek, what
is the greatest power in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England,” said Marek without hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Industry is the greatest
power in the world. And the so-called
‘proletariat’ are likewise the greatest power
in the world. Do you see the scheme now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t see it at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has got control of them both. He
has both industry and the masses in His
power. So everything is in His grasp.
Everything goes to show that He is thinking
of world-supremacy. That’s how things are,
Marek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek sat down. “Wait a bit, Bondy,”
he said. “I’ve been thinking a good deal
about it up here in the mountains. I’ve
been following up everything and comparing
the signs. I tell you, Bondy, I don’t even
give a thought to anything else. I certainly
don’t know what He is aiming at, but I do
know this, Bondy, that He’s following no
particular plan. He doesn’t know Himself
what He wants and how to get it. Possibly
He wants to do something big, but doesn’t
know how to set about it. I’ll tell you
something, Bondy. So far He’s only a force
of Nature. Politically, He’s a fearful ignoramus.
In the matter of economics He’s a
simple savage. After all, He ought to have
submitted to the Church; she has had
experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know, He sometimes
strikes me as being so childish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you believe it, Rudy,” G. H.
Bondy returned heavily. “He knows what
He wants. That’s why He plunged into
large-scale industry. He is far more up to
date than we ever thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is only His play,” urged Marek.
“He only wants something to occupy Himself
with. Don’t you see, there’s a sort of godlike
boyishness about it. Wait, I know what
you want to say. As a worker He is tremendous.
It is simply amazing what He
can bring off. But, Bondy, it is so senseless
that there can’t be any plan in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most senseless things in history
were systematically prosecuted plans,” declared
G. H. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bondy,” said Marek quickly.
“Look at all the papers I have here. I
follow up every step He takes. I tell
you that there isn’t a scrap of consistency
about them. They’re all merely the improvisations
of omnipotence. He performs
tremendous tricks, but at random, disconnectedly,
confusedly. His activity isn’t
organized a scrap. He came into the world
altogether too unprepared. That’s where
His weakness lies. He impresses me, but
I see His weak points. He is not a good
organizer, and perhaps never has been. He
has flashes of genius, but He is unsystematic.
I’m surprised that you haven’t got the better
of Him, Bondy, a wideawake fellow like
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t do anything with Him,”
Bondy asserted. “He attacks you in your
innermost soul, and you’re done for. When
He can’t convince you by reason, He sends
miraculous enlightenment upon you. You
know what He did with Saul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are running away from Him,” said
Marek, “but I am running after Him, and
I’m close at His heels. I know a bit about
Him already, enough to get out a warrant
for Him! Description: infinite, invisible,
and formless. Place of residence: everywhere
in the vicinity of atomic motors.
Occupation: mystical Communism. Crimes
for which He is wanted: alienation of private
property, illegal practice of medicine, offences
against the Public Assemblies Act, interference
with officials in the execution of their
duty, and so forth. Distinguishing marks:
omnipotence. In short, have Him arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re making fun of it,” sighed G. H.
Bondy. “Don’t do it. He has beaten us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet!” cried Marek. “Look here,
Bondy. He doesn’t know how to govern
yet. He has got into a fearful muddle with
His new undertakings. For instance, He
has gone in for over-production instead of
first building up a miraculous railway
system. Now He’s in the mire Himself—what
He produces has no value. That
miraculous profusion of everything was a
fearful fiasco. In the second place, He
turned the brains of the authorities with His
mysticism and upset the whole machinery
of Government, which otherwise He could
now be using to maintain order. You can
make revolutions anywhere else you like,
but not in the Government offices; even if
the world’s to be brought to an end, the
thing to do is to destroy the universe first
and take the Government offices afterwards.
That’s how it is, Bondy. And in
the third place, like the crudest of doctrinaire
Communists, He has done away with the
currency and thereby with one stroke paralysed
the circulation of commodities. He
did not know that the laws of the market are
stronger than the laws of God. He did not
know that production without trade is
utterly senseless. He knew nothing whatever.
He behaved like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, to
put it shortly, as if He would destroy with
one hand what He made with the other.
Here we have miraculous profusion, and
along with it disastrous shortage. He is
all-powerful, yet He’s achieved only chaos.
I believe that He once did really create the
laws of Nature, the primordial lizards, the
mountains, and anything else you like.
But business, Bondy, our modern industry
and commerce, that I swear He did not
create, for He simply doesn’t know a thing
about it. No, Bondy, industry and commerce
are not of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on,” said G. H. Bondy. “I
know that the consequences of His acts are
calamitous .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. immeasurable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But what
can we do about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the time being, nothing. My dear
Bondy, I just study and compare. It is a
second Babel. Here, for instance, you have
the Roman Catholic publications expressing
the suspicion that ‘the confusions of these
times of religious excitement are being
deliberately organized with Satanic subtlety
by the Freemasons.’ The Nationalist Press
blames the Jews, the Socialists of the Right
blame those of the Left, the Agrarian party
attacks the Liberals; it’s killing. And
mind you, we’re not really in the whirlpool
yet. In my opinion, the whole thing is only
just beginning to get into a tangle. Come
here, Bondy, I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that He .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know
what I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that He’s the only one
there is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” replied Bondy. “And
is it of any special importance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immense importance,” Marek answered.
“Come closer, Bondy, and prick up your ears.”</p>

<h3>THE HAMMER AND STAR</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Brother</span> Senior Warden, what do you
see in the East?” asked the Worshipful
Master. He was dressed all in black, wore
the white leather apron, and held the silver
gavel in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the Masters assembled in the
Temple and ready for labour,” said the
Senior Warden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Worshipful Master gave a knock
with his gavel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Junior Warden, what do you
see in the West?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the Masters assembled in the
Temple and ready for labour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Worshipful Master knocked three
times with his gavel. “Let the labour
begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Brothers of the Free French Masonic
Lodge, “The Hammer and Star,” took
their seats, never taking their eyes off the
Worshipful Master, G. H. Bondy, who had
called them together at such an unusual
time. The lodge was as quiet as a church
between the black-draped walls with the
maxims of the craft woven in the hangings.
Bondy, the Worshipful Master, was pale
and thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers,” said the Worshipful Master
after a while, “I have summoned this
unusual meeting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
unusual labour, which in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unusual
opposition to the secret precepts of
our Order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is no mere formality. I
know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I am violating the solemn
and consecrated form of our labour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in
asking you to come to a decision upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a really serious .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and public matter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
of the highest importance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Worshipful Master in the Chair
has the right to order our labour,” declared
the Judex Formidabilis, causing general
agitation among his hearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” began G. H. Bondy, “it
concerns the systematic attacks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon our
Order recently begun .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by the Clerical
party. They state that our secret activities
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the last hundred years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are
connected with certain extraordinary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and regrettable occurrences .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the industrial
and spiritual field. The Clericalist
papers assert that the Masonic Lodges .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
have brought about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. deliberately .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
this unfettering of demoniacal powers. I
ask you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what we ought to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in the present time of calamity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for
the benefit of mankind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and for the
honour of the Most High. This subject is
now open for discussion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s solemn silence the
Junior Warden arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers, at this historic moment, I
welcome, so to speak, the impressive words
uttered by our Worshipful Master. He
spoke, so to speak, of regrettable occurrences.
And indeed, we who concern ourselves, so
to speak, only with the welfare of mankind,
are bound to declare all these regrettable
miracles, illuminations, fits of love for one’s
neighbour, and other disturbances to be
occurrences which are, so to speak, in the
highest degree regrettable. We must with
all the discretion we owe to our Order
decline all connection, so to speak, with
these regrettable facts which, so to speak,
do not agree with the traditional and progressive
principles of our Great Order.
Brothers, these regrettable principles are,
so to speak, in fundamental disagreement
with it, as our Worshipful Master very
rightly said, since the Clericals, so to speak,
have taken up arms against us, and if we
have in mind, so to speak, the highest
interests of mankind, I therefore move that
we should express our agreement in the
fullest sense of the word, as the Worshipful
Master in the Chair very rightly
said, these regrettable occurrences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judex Formidabilis now rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Worshipful Master, I should
like to say a few words. I have to observe
that certain occurrences have been spoken
of here in a very regrettable manner. I am
of opinion that those occurrences are not so
regrettable as our Brother Junior Warden
thinks. I am really not aware which occurrences
Brother Junior Warden is alluding to,
but if he has in mind the religious meetings
which I myself attend, then I am of the
opinion that he is mistaken. Indeed, I will
say frankly that I consider that he is entirely
in error.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I move,” suggested another brother,
“that we should take a vote on whether
the said occurrences are regrettable or
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I move,” said another, taking the
floor, “that we elect a smaller committee, of
some three members, say, to investigate
these regrettable occurrences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in favour of five members.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I vote for twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judex Formidabilis was heard to say,
“Excuse me, brothers, I have not yet
finished speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Worshipful Master rapped with his
gavel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call upon Brother Judex Formidabilis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers,” began Judex gently, “we
will not quarrel who is to have the floor.
The occurrences concerning which several
regrettable opinions have been expressed
here are of a character that deserves attention,
interest, yes, and even respect. I do
not deny that I am a member of several
religious circles who have received divine
grace in especial power. I trust that this
is not inconsistent with the discipline of the
Freemason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said several voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moreover, I have to admit that I myself
have been privileged to perform a few
minor miracles. I think that this does not
conflict with my rank and degree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I therefore, speaking from my
own experiences, state that the aforesaid
occurrences are, on the contrary, praiseworthy,
uplifting, and moral, that they
contribute to the welfare of mankind and
the glory of the Most High, and therefore—from
the Masonic standpoint—there can
be no objection to them. I move that our
Lodge should declare its neutrality with
respect to all these manifestations of the
divine presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Senior Warden rose and said:
“Brothers, I certainly don’t believe in any
of this stuff, and I’ve seen nothing of it;
all the same I’m in favour of standing up
for religion. I don’t think that there’s
anything in it, but is there any reason why
we should say so? I therefore move that
we secretly let it be known that we have
the very best information about the whole
business, and that we approve of things
going on as they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Worshipful Master raised his eyes
and said: “I call the attention of the
brethren to the fact that the Industrial
Federation has elected the Absolute as its
honorary President. Further, that the
M.E.C. shares, the so-called Absolute Stock,
may go up still higher. In this connection
I may say that a donor who wishes to remain
unknown has contributed one thousand
shares to the Benevolent Fund of our Lodge.
The meeting will now proceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Junior Warden announced: “I beg
to withdraw, so to speak, the regrettable
occurrences. From the higher point of view
I entirely agree. I move that we discuss the
matter from the higher point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Worshipful Master raised his eyes
and said, “I have to inform you that the
Grand Lodge intends to issue instructions
relating to the recent occurrences. The
Grand Lodge recommends the Masters
to join religious circles and organize them
in the Masonic sense for the instruction of
apprentices in the craft. The new Temples
are to be conducted in an enlightened and
anticlerical spirit. It is desirable to examine
the various doctrines—monism, abstinence,
Fletcherism, vegetarianism, and so forth.
Each circle is to be instructed in a different
faith in order to test out practically which
is the best for the welfare of mankind and
for the glory of the Most High. These
activities are obligatory on all Masters by
decree of the Grand Lodge. The meeting
will now proceed.”</p>

<h3>IN THE NIGHT EDITOR’S ROOM</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> largest Catholic or popular newspaper,
<span class='it'>The People’s Friend</span>, had not a very large
editorial staff, and so at 9.30 p.m. there were
only two men in the room—Kostal, the
night editor (Heaven knows why night
editors’ pipes have such an amazing stink),
and Father Jost, who sat writing the leader
for the next issue and whistling between his
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Novotny, the printer,
came in with the wet proofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how about the leader, gentlemen,
the leader?” he growled. “When are we
going to set it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Jost stopped humming. “Ready
in a minute, Novotny,” he said quickly.
“There’s just a word I can’t get. Have we
already had ‘satanic machinations’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day before yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha. And has ‘treacherous onslaught’
been used too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’ve had that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Knavish imposture’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ran that to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Impious fabrication’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least six times,” said Kostal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a pity,” sighed Father Jost.
“I think we’ve been a bit too lavish with
our ideas. How did you like to-day’s
leader, Novotny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strong stuff,” said the printer. “But
we ought to be getting on with the
setting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready in a minute,” Father Jost replied.
“I think our friends in higher quarters were
satisfied with this morning’s issue. You’ll
see, his Lordship the Bishop will call on
us. ‘Jost,’ he’ll say, ‘you let them have
it properly.’ Have we used ‘maniacal
ravings’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity! We must bring up fresh
guns and blaze away. ‘Jost,’ his Lordship
said to me not long ago, ‘Up and at them!
Everything may have its day, but we shall
stand for ever and aye.’ Mr. Novotny,
can’t you think of any suitable phrase?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, couldn’t you say ‘criminal narrow-mindedness’
or ‘perverse malignity’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would do splendidly,” said Father
Jost, with a sigh of relief. “Where do you
get all these bright ideas from, Novotny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the old files of <span class='it'>The People’s Friend</span>.
But that leader, your Reverence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have it at once. Just wait a
minute: ‘The criminal narrow-mindedness
or perverse malignity which with the idolatries
of Baal sullies the pure waters from
the rock of Peter I—aha, now we shan’t be
long—sullies the pure waters, rock of Peter,
there we are—and sets up thereon the
golden calf whose name is the Devil or the
Absolute——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got the leader?” came a
voice from the door of the night editor’s
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Laudetur Jesus Christus</span>, my Lord
Bishop,” ejaculated Father Jost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got the leader?” repeated
Bishop Linda, coming hurriedly into the
room. “Who was it that wrote this morning’s
leader? Heaven forgive me, what a
pretty mess you’ve made with it. What
idiot wrote it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I did,” stammered Father Jost,
retreating; “Bishop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your Lordship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve no right to think,” roared
Bishop Linda, his eyeglasses flashing at
him eerily. “Here, take the thing”; and
crumpling up that morning’s issue of <span class='it'>The
People’s Friend</span> in his hand, he flung it at
Jost’s feet. “I thought! Look at him, he
thinks! Why didn’t you telephone? Why
didn’t you ask what you were to write?
And you, Kostal, how could you put it in
the paper? You thought, too, did you?
Novotny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” exclaimed the trembling
printer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you have that stuff set up in
type? Did you think, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, sir,” protested the printer. “I
have to set what they send me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody has to do anything but what
I want,” Bishop Linda declared decisively.
“Jost, sit down and read the drivel you put
together this morning. Read it, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a long time past,” Father Jost read,
in trembling tones, from his own leading
article—“for a long time past the public
has been disturbed by the knavish imposture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knavish imposture, my lord,” groaned
Father Jost. “I thought—I—I see
now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ‘knavish imposture’ is a little
too forcible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I should think. Read on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knavish imposture carried on with
the so-called Absolute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by means of
which the Freemasons, the Jews and other
progressives are befooling the world. It
has been scientifically demonstrated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at Jost! Look at him!” cried
Bishop Linda. “He has scientifically
demonstrated something! Read on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. scientifically demonstrated,” stammered
the unfortunate Jost, “that the so-called
Absolute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is just as impious a
deception .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the tricks performed by
mediums.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop,” said the Bishop with a sudden
amiability. “Take down the following
leading article: ‘It has been scientifically
demonstrated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ Have you got that? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
‘demonstrated that I, Father Jost, am a
jackass, a dolt and an idiot.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have you
got that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” whispered Jost, utterly bewildered.
“Please go on, my .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw that into the waste-paper basket,
my son,” said the Bishop, “and open your
stupid ears. Have you read to-day’s papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my l.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, well, I don’t know. This morning,
my reverend friend, there appeared first of
all a communication from the Monist Association,
asserting that the Absolute is that
Unity which the Monists have always proclaimed
to be God, and that therefore the
cult of the Absolute is in complete correspondence
with the doctrine of Monism.
Did you read that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was also the announcement that
the Masonic Lodges commend the Absolute
to the support of their members. Did you
read that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Further, that at the Synodical Congress
of the Lutherans, Superintendent Maartens
gave a five-hour address in which he proved
the identity of the Absolute with God made
manifest. Did you read that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also that at the convention of the
Seventh International the Russian delegate,
Paruskin-Rebenfeld, moved that honour
should be paid to Comrade God who had
proved His sympathy for the workers by
entering the factories. It had been noted
with gratitude that the Most High Comrade
had decided to work in place of the expropriated
classes. A motion was brought forward
that as a further proof of solidarity
He should begin a general strike in all His
undertakings. After the presiding officers
had deliberated in private, the motion was
recalled as premature. Did you read that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finally a resolution was passed that the
Absolute was the exclusive property of the
proletariat, and that the bourgeoisie had no
right to do honour to Him or to benefit
by His miracles. Instructions were given
to devise a scheme for a workers’ cult of the
Absolute and to carry out secret defensive
measures in case capital should attempt to
exploit or appropriate the Absolute. Did
you read that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There also appeared an announcement
by the Free Thought Society, a notice sent
in by the Salvation Army, a communiqué
from the Theosophical Centre ‘Adyar,’ an
open letter addressed to the Absolute and
signed by the Benevolent Association of
Landlords, an announcement by the Federation
of Merry-Go-Round Proprietors, signed
by the President, J. Binder, besides <span class='it'>The
Voice of the Union of Constance</span>, special
numbers of the <span class='it'>Voice from the Beyond</span>, the
<span class='it'>Anabaptist Reader</span> and the <span class='it'>Abstainer</span>—did
you read all that, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, my dear son, you see this:
that in every case they make the most solemn
claim that the Absolute is their own private
property, they do Him honour, and make
Him splendid offers, appoint Him honorary
member, patron, protector, and Heaven
knows what else—and meanwhile on our
side some crazy lunatic of a Father Jost—Jost,
if you please, an insignificant object
called Jost—shouts out to the universe that
it’s all a knavish imposture and a swindle
already scientifically exposed. Saints and
martyrs, you’ve got us into a pretty fix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my lord, I had orders to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
write against .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those phenomena .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you had,” the Bishop interrupted
him sternly. “But didn’t you see that the
situation had entirely changed? Jost,”
cried the Bishop, rising to his feet, “our
churches are empty, our flock is running
after the Absolute. Jost, you blockhead, if
we wish to bring our flock back to us, we
must secure the Absolute. We will set up
Atomic Karburators in all our churches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but that, my little priest, is above your head.
Bear in mind this one thing: the Absolute
must work for us; He must be ours, i.e.
He must be ours alone. <span class='it'>Capiscis, mi fili?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Capisco</span>,” whispered Father Jost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Deo gratias!</span> Now, friend Jost, now
shall Saul become Paul. You’ll write a nice
little leading article in which you will make
it known that the Sacred Congregation,
taking cognizance of the petitions of the
faithful, has admitted the Absolute into the
bosom of the Church. Mr. Novotny, here
is the Apostolic Letter to that effect; have
it set up in large bold type on the front
page of the paper. Kostal, announce among
the local news items that Mr. G. H. Bondy
will on Sunday next receive the sacrament
of baptism at the hands of the Archbishop,
and add a few words of hearty welcome, of
course, you understand? And you, Jost,
sit down and write .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wait a minute;
we want something really striking to lead
off with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might say something after this
style, my lord: The criminal narrow-mindedness
and the perverse malignity of
certain bodies .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid! Then say: ‘The criminal
narrow-mindedness and the perverse malignity
of certain bodies have for some months
past been active in endeavouring to mislead
our people into the paths of error. False and
heretical doctrines have been proclaimed to
the effect that the Absolute is something
other than the selfsame God to whom we
have from the cradle raised our hands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
Have you got that? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. raised our hands
in childlike faith .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have
you got that? Continue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>THE PROCESS OF CANONIZATION</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>You</span> will readily understand that the admission
of the Absolute to the bosom of the
Church afforded, under the given circumstances,
a great surprise. It was carried
out by virtue of the Papal Brief alone, and
the College of Cardinals, being faced with
the accomplished fact, merely deliberated
whether the sacrament of baptism should be
conferred upon the Absolute. It was decided
to dispense with this. There was certainly
well-known ecclesiastical precedent for the
baptism of a God (<span class='it'>vide</span> John the Baptist);
but even in such a case the candidate for
baptism must be present in person. Besides,
it was a very delicate political question to
decide which reigning potentate was to be
godfather to the Absolute. The Sacred
Congregation therefore recommended that
at the next Pontifical Mass the Holy Father
should pray for the new member of the
Church, and this was duly carried out in
very solemn form. It was also made part
of the body of Church doctrine that in
addition to the sacrament of baptism and
baptism by blood the Church also recognized
baptism through works of piety,
meritoriousness, and virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must also be recorded that three days
before the publication of the Papal Brief
the Pope gave a lengthy audience to G. H.
Bondy, who was afterwards in conference
with the Papal Secretary, Monsignor Cullatti,
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost simultaneously the summary beatification
of the Absolute was enacted under
the rule <span class='it'>super cultu immemorabili</span> in recognition
of the virtuous life of the Absolute,
now declared Blessed, and a regular but
expedited process of canonization was
arranged for. There was, however, one
highly important innovation: the Absolute
was to be declared, not a Saint, but a God.
A Deification Commission was immediately
appointed from among the best of the
Church’s scholars and pastors. Varesi, the
Cardinal Archbishop of Venice, was appointed
Procurator Dei, while Monsignor
Cullatti was to act as Advocatus Diaboli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cardinal Varesi presented seventeen thousand
testimonies to miracles performed, signed
by nearly all the cardinals, patriarchs, primates,
metropolitans, princes of the Church,
archbishops, principals of Orders, and abbots.
To each testimonial were appended expert
reports by medical authorities and members
of faculties, opinions from professors of
natural sciences, technicians, and economists,
as well as the signatures of eye-witnesses
and legal authentications. These seventeen
thousand documents, Monsignor Varesi
stated, represented but an insignificant
fraction of the miracles actually performed
by the Absolute, their number having already
at a conservative estimate exceeded thirty
millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to this the Procurator Dei
secured detailed expert opinions from the
greatest scientific specialists in the world.
Professor Gardien, Rector of the medical
faculty in Paris, for example, after exhaustive
researches, wrote as follows: “Seeing that
innumerable cases presented to us for examination
were from a medical standpoint completely
hopeless and scientifically incurable
(paralysis, cancer of the throat, blindness
after surgical removal of both eyes, lameness
following on amputation of both the lower
extremities, death following on complete
separation of the head from the trunk,
strangulation in a subject hanged two days
before, etc.), the medical faculty of the
Sorbonne is of the opinion that the so-called
miraculous cures in such cases can only be
ascribed either to complete ignorance of
anatomical and pathological conditions,
clinical inexperience, and utter incompetence
in medical practice, or—a possibility we do
not wish to exclude—to the interference
of higher powers not limited by the laws of
nature or any knowledge thereof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Meadow of Glasgow, the psychologist,
wrote: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since in these activities
there is manifest what is obviously a thinking
being, capable of association, memory, and
even of logical judgment, a being which performs
these psychic operations without the
medium of a brain and nervous system, it
affords a striking corroboration of my crushing
criticism of the psychophysical parallelism
advocated by Professor Meyer. I affirm
that the so-called Absolute is a psychic,
conscious, and intelligent being, albeit our
scientific knowledge of its nature is as yet
but small.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Lupen of the Brno Technical
Institute wrote: “From the standpoint of
effective performance, the Absolute is a
force deserving of the highest respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The famous chemist, Willibald of Tubingen,
wrote: “The Absolute possesses all
the requisite conditions of existence and
scientific evolution, as it is in admirable conformity
with Einstein’s theory of Relativity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present chronicler will no longer
detain you with the pronouncements of the
world’s scientific luminaries; in any case
they were all published in the Acts of the
Holy See.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The process of canonization went forward
in quick time. In the meantime a committee
of eminent authorities on dogma and
exegesis had completed a statement in which
the identity of the Absolute with the Third
Person of the Trinity was definitely established
on the basis of the Scriptures and the
writings of the Fathers of the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before the ceremony of deification
took place, the Patriarch of Constantinople
declared, as head of the Eastern Church,
the identity of the Absolute with the First
Person of the Trinity, the Creator. This
undeniably heretical teaching was espoused
by the Old Catholics, the circumcised
Christians of Abyssinia, the Evangelicals of
the Helvetian Confession, the Nonconformists,
and several of the larger American
sects. This brought about a lively theological
dispute. As for the Jews, a secret
doctrine spread among them to the effect
that the Absolute was Baal of old; the
Liberal Jews announced that they would in
that case recognize Baal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Free Thought Society assembled in
Basle. In the presence of two thousand
delegates the Absolute was proclaimed as
the God of the Freethinkers, and this was
followed by an incredibly violent attack
upon clerics of all denominations, who, in
the terms of the resolution, “are eager to
seek their own advantage with the one
scientific God and to drag Him down into
the filthy cage of ecclesiastical dogma and
priestly deception, and leave Him there to
starve.” But the God who has made Himself
manifest to the eyes of every progressive
modern thinker “has nothing to do with
the mediæval traffic of these Pharisees; the
Free Thought Association alone is His
congregation, and only the Basle Congress
has the right to set forth the doctrine and
the ritual of the Free Religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about the same time the German
Monist Association laid in Leipzig, with
great pomp and ceremony, the foundation-stone
of the future Cathedral of the Atomic
God. There was some disturbance, in
which sixteen persons were injured and
Lüttgen, the famous physicist, had his
spectacles smashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>News was also received that autumn of
some religious phenomena in the Belgian
Congo and in French Senegambia. The
negroes quite unexpectedly slaughtered and
ate the missionaries and bowed down to a
new idol which they called Ato or Alolto.
It afterwards appeared that these idols were
atomic motors, and that German officers
and agents were in some way implicated in
the matter. On the other hand, during the
Moslem rising which broke out at Mecca
in December of the same year, several
French emissaries were found to have been
present, who had concealed twelve light
atomic motors of the Aero pattern in the
neighbourhood of the Kaaba. The ensuing
rebellion of the Mohammedans in Egypt
and Tripoli, and the massacres in Arabia,
cost the lives of about thirty thousand
Europeans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deification of the Absolute was at
length accomplished in Rome on the twelfth
of December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven thousand priests with lighted candles
escorted the Holy Father to St. Peter’s,
where the largest twelve-ton Karburator,
a gift from the M.E.C. to the Holy See,
had been erected behind the high altar.
The ceremony lasted five hours, and twelve
hundred of the faithful and the spectators
were crushed to death. At the stroke of
noon the Pope intoned the “In nomine
Dei Deus,” and at the same moment the
bells of all the Catholic churches in the
world were set ringing as all the bishops
and priests turned from the altars and
announced to the world of believers:
“Habemus Deum.”</p>

<h3>ST. KILDA</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>St. Kilda</span> is a little island, practically
nothing more than a rock of pliocene tufa
far to the west of the Hebrides. A few
stunted birches, a handful of heather and
dry grass, flocks of nesting seagulls and
semi-arctic butterflies of the order <span class='it'>Polyommatus</span>
are all that lives on this lost outpost
of our hemisphere, out amid the endless
beating of the seas and the equally endless
procession of clouds for ever laden with
rain. For that matter, St. Kilda has always
been uninhabited, is now, and will for ever
be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless it was there that His Majesty’s
ship <span class='it'>Dragon</span> dropped anchor, towards the
end of autumn. Carpenters came off the
ship with timbers and planks, and by
evening they had built a large, low wooden
house. The next day upholsterers arrived,
bringing with them the finest and most
comfortable furniture. On the third day
stewards, cooks, and waiters emerged from
the depths of the ship and carried into the
building crockery, wine, preserves, and
everything that civilization has provided for
rich, fastidious, and powerful men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the fourth day there
arrived on H.M.S. <span class='it'>Edwin</span> the English
Premier, the Right Hon. Sir W. O’Patterney,
half an hour later came the American
Ambassador, Mr. Horatio Bumm; and
there followed him, each on a warship, the
Chinese plenipotentiary, Mr. Kei; the French
Premier, Dudieu; the Imperial Russian
General, Buchtin; the Imperial German
Chancellor, Dr. Wurm; the Italian Minister,
Prince Trivelino; and the Japanese Ambassador,
Baron Yanato. Sixteen English
torpedo-boats cruised around St. Kilda to
prevent newspaper reporters from landing;
for this Conference of the Supreme Council
of the Great Powers, which had been summoned
in great haste by the all-powerful
Sir W. O’Patterney, was to take place under
conditions of the strictest secrecy. In fact,
the large Danish whaling schooner <span class='it'>Nyls Hans</span>
was torpedoed while attempting to slip
through the cordon of destroyers by night.
The losses included, in addition to the
twelve men of the crew, Mr. Joe Hashek,
political correspondent of the <span class='it'>Chicago Tribune</span>.
Nevertheless, the representative of
the <span class='it'>New York Herald</span>, Mr. I. Sawitt, spent
the whole time on St. Kilda disguised as
a waiter, and we are indebted to his pen
for the scanty accounts of that memorable
assembly which survived even the subsequent
historic catastrophes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. I. Sawitt was of the opinion that
this Conference on high politics was being
held in this lonely spot in order to eliminate
any direct influence of the Absolute on its
decisions. In any other place the Absolute
might well make its way into this
gathering of serious statesmen in the guise of
inspiration, enlightenment, or even miracle-working—which
would certainly be something
utterly unprecedented in high politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The primary purpose of the Conference
was ostensibly to reach an agreement on colonial
policy. The States were to come to an
agreement not to support or assist religious
movements on the territory of other States.
The incentive to this step was the German
agitation in the Congo and Senegambia, as
well as the subterranean French influence
behind the outbreak of Mahdism in Moslem
countries under British rule, and particularly
the shipments of Karburators from Japan to
Bengal, where a furious revolt of the most
diverse sects was raging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deliberations were held behind closed
doors. The only news given out for publication
was that spheres of interest had been
allotted to Germany in Kurdistan and to
Japan on certain Greek islands. It would
seem that the Anglo-Japanese and the
Franco-German-Russian alliances were on
this occasion unusually cordial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon Mr. G. H. Bondy
arrived on a special torpedo-boat, and was
received in audience by the Supreme Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until about five o’clock (Greenwich
time) did the illustrious diplomats sit
down to luncheon, and it was here that
I. Sawitt had the first opportunity of hearing
with his own ears the representatives
of the high contracting parties. After the
meal they discussed sport and actresses.
Sir W. O’Patterney, with his poet’s head
with its white mane and soulful eyes, talked
enthusiastically about salmon-fishing with
His Excellency the French Premier, Dudieu,
whose energetic gestures, loud voice, and a
certain <span class='it'>je ne sais quoi</span>, revealed the former
lawyer. Baron Yanato, refusing all liquid
refreshment, listened silently and smiled as
though his mouth were full of water. Dr.
Wurm turned over his papers, General
Buchtin walked up and down the room with
Prince Trivelino, Horatio Bumm was making
cannons all by himself on the billiard-table (I
have myself seen his lovely overhand massé
stroke, which would win the admiration of
any expert), while Mr. Kei, looking like a
very yellow and very withered old lady,
fingered some kind of Buddhist rosary. He
was a mandarin in his own Flowery Land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly all the diplomats grouped themselves
round M. Dudieu, who was explaining:
“Yes, gentlemen, <span class='it'>c’est ça</span>. We
cannot remain indifferent to Him. We
must either recognize Him or deny Him.
We Frenchmen are in favour of the latter
course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s because He’s showing himself
such an anti-militarist in your country,” said
Prince Trivelino with a certain malicious
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, gentlemen,” cried Dudieu, “don’t
deceive yourselves on that point. The
French army is quite unaffected. Such an
anti-militarist! Bah! We already had any
number of anti-militarists! Beware of Him,
gentlemen. He is a demagogue, a communist,
a bigot, Heaven knows what not,
but always a radical. <span class='it'>Oui, un rabouliste, c’est
ça.</span> He sticks to the wildest popular catchwords.
He goes with the mob. Now in
your Highness’s country”—he turned suddenly
to Prince Trivelino—“He is a nationalist,
intoxicating Himself with dreams of
a great Roman Empire. But take care, your
Highness: that’s what He does in the
cities, but in the country districts He hobnobs
with the parsons and performs miracles
at the shrines of the Virgin. He works
for the Vatican with one hand and for the
Quirinal with the other. Either there is
some design in it or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know
what. Gentlemen, we can quite frankly
admit it: He is making things difficult
for us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my country,” said Horatio Bumm
thoughtfully, leaning on his cue, “He goes
in for sport as well. He’s a real big sportsman.
He goes in for all sorts of games.
He’s made amazing records in sports even
among chapel-folk. He’s a Socialist. He’s
on the side of the Wets. He changes water
into drink. Why, just lately, at a White
House banquet, everybody present, everybody,
mind you, got frightfully drunk.
They didn’t take anything but water, you
see, but He changed it into drink after it
was down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s queer,” said Sir W. O’Patterney.
“In my country He strikes one as much
more of a Conservative. He behaves like
an omnipotent clergyman. Holds meetings,
processions, sermons in the streets, and such
things. I think He is opposed to us
Liberals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baron Yanato then said smilingly: “In
my country He is quite at home. A very,
very nice God. He has adapted Himself
very well. Indeed, a very great Japanese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Japanese?” croaked
out General Buchtin. “What are you talking
about, batushko? He’s a Russian, a genuine
Russian, a Slav. With the great Russian
soul, your Excellency. He’s on the side of
us moujiks. Not long ago our Archimandrite
arranged a procession in his honour: ten
thousand candles, and people, gospodin, thick
as poppy seeds. All the Christian souls of
Mother Russia had gathered together for
it. He even performed miracles for us.
For He is our Father,” added the General,
crossing himself and bowing low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Imperial Chancellor approached,
and after listening for a while in
silence, he said: “Yes, He knows just how
to appeal to the people. In every case, He
adopts the mentality of the country He is
in. Considering His age, He is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hm
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. astoundingly elastic. We notice it in
the countries just around us. In Czechoslovakia,
for instance, He behaves like a
colossal individualist. Everyone there has
his own Absolute all to himself, so to speak.
We ourselves have a State Absolute. With
us the Absolute immediately developed into
the higher consciousness of the State. In
Poland He acts like a kind of alcohol;
with us He acts like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a sort
of Higher Command, <span class='it'>verstehen sie mich</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even in your Catholic provinces?”
asked Prince Trivelino with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are mere local differences,” replied
Dr. Wurm. “Don’t attach any importance
to them, gentlemen. Germany is more
united than ever before. But I must thank
you, Prince, for the Catholic Karburators
that you are smuggling over to us. Fortunately
they are poorly made, like all
Italian products.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, gentlemen,” interrupted
Sir W. O’Patterney. “Neutrality in religious
questions, please. For my own part, I use
a double hook for salmon. The other day
I caught one as long as that, look! Fourteen
pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about the Papal Nuncio?”
asked Dr. Wurm quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Holy See requests us to maintain
order at all costs. It wants us to have
mysticism prohibited by the police. That
wouldn’t do in England, and altogether .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, I assure you it weighed quite fourteen
pounds. Heavens, I had all I could do to
keep from falling into the water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baron Yanato smiled still more politely.
“But we do not wish for neutrality. He is
a great Japanese. The whole world can
adopt the Japanese faith. We, too, would
like to send out missionaries for once, and
teach religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baron,” said Sir W. O’Patterney gravely,
“you know that the excellent relations
existing between our Governments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England can adopt the Japanese faith,”
smiled Baron Yanato, “and our relations
will be even better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, batushko,” cried General Buchtin.
“We’ll have no Japanese faith. If there’s
to be any faith, then it must be the Orthodox
faith. And do you know why? First,
because it is orthodox, and secondly, because
it is Russian, and thirdly, because our Czar
so wills it, and fourthly, because we, my
friend, have the biggest army. I do everything
like a soldier, gentlemen: downright
frankly and openly. If there’s to be a religion,
then it’s to be our Orthodox religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, gentlemen, that is not the question,”
cried Sir W. O’Patterney excitedly. “That
isn’t what we’re here for!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right,” said Dr. Wurm. “We
have to agree upon a common line of conduct
with regard to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which one?” suddenly asked the
Chinese plenipotentiary, Mr. Kei, lifting
at last his wrinkled eyelids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which one?” repeated Dr. Wurm in
astonishment. “Why, surely there’s only
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Japanese God,” smiled Baron
Yanato blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Orthodox Greek God, batushko,
and none other,” contradicted the General,
as red in the face as a turkey-cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buddha,” Mr. Kei said, and again
dropped his lids, becoming the very counterpart
of a dried-up mummy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir W. O’Patterney stood up agitatedly.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “kindly follow me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon the diplomats again proceeded
to the council chamber. At eight o’clock
in the evening His Excellency, General
Buchtin, rushed out, purple in the face, and
clenching his fists. After him came Dr.
Wurm, agitatedly arranging his papers.
Sir W. O’Patterney, regardless of polite
usage, came out with his hat on his head:
his face was deep red; M. Dudieu followed
him in silence. Prince Trivelino walked
away, looking very pale, Baron Yanato at
his heels with his perpetual smile. The
last to leave was Mr. Kei, with downcast
eyes, an exceedingly long black rosary sliding
through his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This concludes the report which I. Sawitt
published in the <span class='it'>Herald</span>. No official communication
concerning this Conference was
given out, except the one already mentioned
relating to the spheres of interest, and if
any decision was taken it was apparently
of no great value. For already, to use the
familiar gynæcological phrase, unforeseen
events were shaping themselves in the
“womb of history.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch21'>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<h3>THE TELEGRAM</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Snow</span> was falling in the mountains. All
night through it had come down in great
silent flakes; nearly two feet deep of it lay
there new-fallen, and still the white starlets
of snow floated earthwards without a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence lay over the forests, save that
now and then a branch would snap beneath
too great a load, and the sound would drive
itself a little path through the stillness intensified
by the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it grew colder, and from the direction
of Prussia came whistling an icy wind.
The soft flakes changed into stinging hail
hurling itself straight into your face. The
fallen snow rose in sharp needle-points and
whirled through the air. White clouds blew
down from the trees, swirled madly above
the ground, spun about, and soared up to
the darkened heavens. It was snowing
upwards from the earth to the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the depths of the forest the branches
were creaking and groaning; a tree broke
and fell with a crash, shattering the undergrowth.
But abrupt noises like these were
sundered and swept away on the whistling,
booming, shrieking, rending, distracted howl
of the wind. When for an instant it ceased,
you could hear the frozen snow crunching
shrilly under your feet like powdered glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above Spindelmühl a telegraph messenger
was making his way through the storm. It
was confoundedly heavy going through the
heaped-up snow. The messenger had his
cap fastened tight over his ears with a red
handkerchief, and had woollen gloves on,
and a gaudy scarf round his neck, and still
he was cold. “Ah, well,” he was thinking,
“in another hour and a half at any rate I’ll
have crawled up to Bear Valley, and I’ll
borrow a sledge for the run down. But
what the devil possesses people to send
telegrams in filthy weather like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Maiden’s Bridge a gust caught
him and spun him round nearly in a circle.
With frozen hands he clung to the post of
the signboard set there for tourists. “Holy
Virgin!” he muttered, “this surely can’t
last!” And then across a clearing a huge
cloud-like mass of snow came whirling
towards him—coming nearer and nearer—now
down upon him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he must hold his
breath at all costs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A thousand needle-points
drove into his face and made their
way inside his coat; through a little rent
in his clothing the icy particles reached his
skin; the man was drenched beneath his
frozen garments. The cloud blew past, and
the messenger felt very much disposed to
turn back to the post-office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marek, Engineer”—he repeated the
address to himself. “Well, he certainly
don’t belong to these parts. But a telegram’s
urgent, you never know what it’s
about—one of his family, maybe, or something
important.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm calmed down a little, and the
messenger struck out across the Maiden’s
Bridge and up along the stream. The snow
crunched under his heavy boots, and his
feet were frightfully cold. Once more the
wind began to howl, and great lumps of
snow fell from the trees; the messenger
caught a full load of it on his head and
under his scarf; a trickle of icy water ran
down his back. But what plagued him most
was that his feet were slipping wickedly on
the hardened snow, and his path now ran
steeply up the slope. Next moment he was
caught in a hurricane of snow. Like a
white wall it came crashing down upon him.
Before the messenger had a chance to turn,
he got the full force of it in his face; he
bent forward with the utmost effort, gasping
for breath. He took a step upward and
fell. Then he sat up with his back to the
wind, but he was seized with a dread of
being buried by the snow. He got up and
tried to scramble on, but slipped again, fell
on both hands, pulled himself up again, but
slid backward a good way. He held on
to the trees to steady himself, breathing
heavily. “Curse it,” he said to himself,
“I’ve got to get up there somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He managed to take a few steps, but fell
once more, and slid downwards on his
stomach. He began to crawl on all fours.
His gloves were wet, the snow was inside
his leggings, but he must push on. Anything
rather than stay there! Melting snow
and sweat poured down his cheeks. He
could not see for the driving snow, and it
looked as though he had lost his way; it
made him weep aloud as he crept toilsomely
upward. But it was hard work crawling
along on all fours in a long coat; he stood
up again and stepped forward, battling with
the blizzard. For every half-step he made
forward he slipped two steps back; he did
climb a little farther, but then his feet flew
out from under him, and he slid downward
with his face buried in the prickly snow.
When he picked himself up, he found that
he had lost his stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile clouds of snow were flying
over the mountains, massing on the rocks,
hissing, bellowing, roaring. The messenger
sobbed aloud, gasping with terror and exertion;
he climbed on, stopped, took another
step and another, halted, turned his back
to the wind and took a deep breath
through his burning mouth, and then—O
Christ in Heaven!—took one step more.
He held on to a tree. What was the time?
With the greatest effort he drew out his
turnip watch in its transparent yellow case.
It was encrusted with snow. Perhaps darkness
was coming on. Should he turn back?
But he couldn’t have far to go now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fitful gale had changed into a steady
blizzard. Clouds rolled along the slope, a
dark and dirty mist full of hurtling sleet.
The snow rushed down horizontally, straight
into his face, blocking up the eyes, nose and
mouth; with wet frozen fingers it had to
be dug, half melted, from the cavities of
the ears and eyes. The front of the messenger’s
body was covered with a layer of snow
two inches thick; his coat was rigid, as
stiff and heavy as a board—you could not
bend it; the cakes of snow on his boot-soles
grew bigger and heavier with every
step. And in the forest it was getting dark.
And yet, good heavens, it was barely two
in the afternoon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a greenish-yellow darkness
poured over the forest, and the snow
gushed down like a cloudburst. Flakes
the size of your hand, wet and heavy, flew
whirling by so thickly that the dividing line
between earth and air was lost. A man cannot
see a step in front of him. He breathes
the flakes in, wades on through the roaring
blizzard that dashes high over his head,
pushes on blindly as if he were cutting a
little passage down there under the snow.
He has but one overmastering instinct—to
push on. He yearns for one thing only—to
breathe something other than snow. He
can no longer lift his feet from the snow;
he drags them through the drifts reaching
half-way to his hips; he makes a track
which instantly closes up behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile in the cities far below a few
sparse flakes fluttered down to be melted into
black mud. The lights were lit in the shops,
the cafés were all aglow, people sat around
under the electric globes and grumbled
what a miserable gloomy day it was.
Numberless lights were ablaze all over the
great city, sparkling in the watery mire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One solitary glimmer shone over the
storm-swept field on the mountain. It
pierced with difficulty through the falling
snow, wavered up and down, and nearly
expired; nevertheless, it was there, still
shining. There was a light in the Hut in
Bear Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was five o’clock, and therefore pitch-dark,
when a shapeless something stopped
in front of the Hut in Bear Valley. That
“something” spread out its thick white
wings and began to beat its body with
them and peel off a coating of snow four
inches thick. Beneath the snow a coat
became visible, and below the coat two feet,
and these feet stamped on the stone doorstep,
till great lumps of snow dropped from
them. It was the messenger from Spindelmühl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the hut and saw a thin gentleman
sitting at the table. He tried to utter
a greeting, but his voice failed him completely.
It only made a little wheezing noise
like that of escaping steam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man rose: “My good man,
what the devil brings you here in a blizzard
like this? Why, you might never have got
through alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The messenger nodded and gurgled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it isn’t absolute madness!” growled
the other, and told the servant to bring some
tea. “Well, where were you making for,
then, dad? Martin’s Hut?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The messenger shook his head and opened
his leather pouch; it was full of snow; he
took out a telegram frozen so stiff that it
crackled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bha, bha, Bharek?” he croaked out
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say?” asked the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. named .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Mar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ek, an .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eng .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. i .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neer?”
the messenger stammered out with a reproachful
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me,” the thin gentleman cried.
“Have you something for me? Let me
see it, quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marek tore open the telegram. It read:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='it'>Your predictions confirmed.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Bondy.</span>”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Nothing more.</p>

<h3>THE OLD PATRIOT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Prague office of the <span class='it'>People’s Journal</span>
everyone was working at top speed. The
telephone operator was yelling furiously into
the telephone and quarrelling with the young
lady at the Exchange. Scissors clicked and
typewriters clattered, and Mr. Cyril Keval
sat on the table and dangled his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, they’re holding a meeting at
Vaclavak,” he said in a low voice. “Some
Communist’s up there preaching voluntary
poverty. He’s haranguing the people,
telling them they ought to be like the lilies
of the field. He’s got a beard right down
to his waist. What a frightful lot of long-bearded
chaps there are about nowadays!
All looking like apostles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” answered old Rejzek, turning
over the papers from the Czechoslovak Press
Bureau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes their beards grow so
long?” Mr. Keval ruminated. “I say,
Rejzek, I do believe the Absolute has
something to do with that as well. Golly,
Rejzek, I’m afraid of something of the sort
growing on me. Just imagine it, right down
to the waist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” Mr. Rejzek said ponderously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Free Thought Society is holding
a service in Havliček Square to-day. Father
Novaček is performing miracles in Tyl
Square. There’s sure to be a row between
them, you’ll see. Yesterday Novaček healed
a man who had been lame from birth.
Then they had a procession, and just think,
the fellow who’d been lame gave a Jew an
awful hiding. Broke three of his ribs or
more. He was a Zionist, see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” remarked Mr. Rejzek, marking
some items of news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s <span class='it'>certain</span> to be a dust-up to-day,
Rejzek,” Keval expatiated. “The Progressives
are holding a meeting in the Old Town
Square. They’ve trotted out ‘Away from
Rome’ again. And Father Novaček is
organizing the Maccabeans; you know, a
sort of Catholic armed guard. You wait,
there will be a scrimmage. The Archbishop
has forbidden Novaček to perform miracles,
but his Reverence is like one possessed; he
even goes and raises the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” said Mr. Rejzek, and went on
marking copy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a letter from my mother,” Cyril
Keval confided in subdued tones. “At
home in Moravia, you know, near Hustopec
and thereabouts, they’re simply raving mad
with the Czechs—say they’re heathen and
heretics and idolaters and want to set up new
gods, and all that stuff. They’ve shot a
gamekeeper there because he was a Czech.
I tell you, Rejzek, things are fairly seething
everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” came Mr. Rejzek’s sign of
acquiescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve even gone for each other in the
synagogue,” continued Mr. Keval. “The
Zionists gave the people who believe in Baal
a fearful licking. There were even three
people killed. And have you heard about
the split among the Communists? There
you are, I nearly forgot about it; that’s
another grand mix-up. Now we’re going
to have the mystic Communists, a sort of
left wing; then the Christians, Marians,
Scientists, Resurrectionites, textile Knights
of St. John, iron Knights, miner Knights,
and about seven other parties. Now they’re
squabbling about the sick benefit funds and
the workmen’s dwellings. Just wait, I’m
going to slip over to Hybernska Street this
afternoon. My boy, the garrison was confined
to barracks this afternoon; but in the
meantime the Vršovice barracks have sent an
ultimatum to the Černin barracks calling on
them to recognize the Vršovice dogma of
the Three Degrees of Salvation. If they
don’t accept the doctrine, they are to report
for battle at Sandberk. The Dejvice artillerymen
have gone to the Černin barracks
to disband. The Vršovice garrison has
barricaded itself in, the soldiers have planted
machine-guns in the windows and declared
war. They are being besieged by the
Seventh Dragoons, the Castle Guard, and
four light batteries. They’ve been given
six hours, then the firing will begin.
Rejzek, it’s a real pleasure to be alive in
these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” said Mr. Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and at the University to-day,”
Keval went on quietly, “the natural science
faculty and the history faculty came to blows.
You know, the natural science faculty, being
rather pantheistic, so to speak, disputes the
Revelation. The professors conducted the
fight, and Dean Radl himself carried the
flag. The historians fortified the University
Library in the Klementinum and defended
themselves desperately, armed with books.
Dean Radl got hit on the head with a bound
volume of Velenovsky and was killed on the
spot. Probably concussion of the brain.
The Rector, Arne Novak, was seriously
injured by a volume of <span class='it'>Invention and
Progress</span>. Finally the historians buried the
attacking party under the Collected Works
of Jan Vrba. Now the sappers are at
work on the scene of the battle, and so
far they’ve recovered seven corpses, among
them three lecturers. I don’t think there
were more than thirty buried, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” observed Mr. Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there’s the Sparta Club, my boy,”
Keval rattled on with mild enthusiasm.
“The Sparta has proclaimed that the only
God is the Greek Zeus, whereas the Slavia
votes for Svantovit, the old sun-god. On
Sunday there’s to be a match between the
two Gods on the Letna. Besides their footballs,
both clubs will bring hand-grenades,
and the Slavia will also have machine-guns
and the Sparta a twelve-centimetre gun.
There’s a terrific rush for tickets. The
supporters of both clubs will be armed.
Rejzek, believe me, there will be a shindy!
I bet Zeus will win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” said Mr. Rejzek, “but now
you might have a look at the post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t care,” cried Cyril Keval.
“A man can get used even to a God, can’t
he? What’s the latest from the Press
Bureau?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing special,” growled Mr. Rejzek.
“Bloodshed at demonstrations in Rome.
They’re going for each other in Ulster—you
know, the Irish Catholics. The St. Kilda
agreement is being repudiated all round.
Pogroms in Budapest; a schism in France—the
Waldenses have bobbed up there
again, and the Anabaptists in Münster. At
Bologna an Anti-Pope has been elected,
one Father Martin of the Barefoot Friars.
And so on. Nothing of local interest. Have
a look at the letters, will you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cyril Keval stopped talking and began
opening the letters. There were a few
hundred of them, but he had hardly read
half a dozen when he was off once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Rejzek,” he began, “it’s
the same tale all the way through. Take
this one for instance: From Chrudim.
Dear Sir,—As an old subscriber to your
esteemed journal, your readers and the
whole of the public who are now being
harassed by unprofitable disputes”—(“He’s
left out ‘will be interested,’ ” interpolated
Mr. Keval)—“ ‘in the remarkable miracle
performed by our local pastor, the Rev.
Father Zakoupil.’ And so on. In Jicin
it was the storekeeper of the Co-operative
Society, and in Benesov it was the superintendent
of schools. In Chotěboř it was
even the widow Jirák, who keeps a tobacco
shop. Have I to read all this stuff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work went on again in silence for a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it, Rejzek,” Keval burst out
again, “I say, do you know what would
be a real sensation? A giant gooseberry?
A lovely canard? Why, if something were
to happen quite in the natural way, without
any miracle about it. But I don’t think
anyone would believe us. Wait a bit, I’ll
try to think up something natural.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there was a brief period of quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rejzek,” cried Keval mournfully, “I
simply can’t think up anything natural.
When I think it over, everything is a miracle
really. Whatever is, is a sort of magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the editor-in-chief entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did the cuttings from the <span class='it'>Tribune</span>?
Here’s a story in it that we haven’t got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a story?” asked Mr.
Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Finance and Commerce Section.
An American combine has bought up the
Pacific Islands and is subletting them. A
tiny coral atoll costs fifty thousand dollars a
year. Big demand even from the Continent
of Europe. Shares have gone up to two
thousand seven hundred already. G. H.
Bondy interested to the extent of one
hundred and twenty millions. And we
haven’t got a word about it,” said the
editor-in-chief angrily, and slammed the
door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rejzek,” cried Keval, “here’s an interesting
letter: ‘Dear Sir,—Forgive an old
patriot, who can remember the evil times of
oppression and the dark days of serfdom,
if he raises a plaintive voice and begs you
to use your skilful pen to make known to
the Czech people the grief and sore anxiety
we old patriots feel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ and so on. Farther
on he says: ‘In our ancient and glorious
nation we see brother egged on against
brother; innumerable parties, sects, and
churches struggling together like wolves and
destroying each other in their mutual hatred’—(must
be some very old chap; his writing
is terribly shaky)—‘while our ancient enemy
prowls around us like a roaring lion, filling
the minds of our people with the German
watchword of “Away from Rome,” and supported
by those mistaken patriots who set
the interests of their party before the national
unity for which we yearn. And we behold
with anguish and sorrow the prospect of a
new battle of Lipany, where Czech ranged
against Czech under the cloak of different
religious watchwords, will be left lying on
the bloody field. And so, alas, the words of
the Scriptures about a kingdom divided
against itself will be fulfilled. And there
shall be piercing and felling of many, as it
is written in our own glorious and authentic
cycles of chivalry.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s enough,” said Mr. Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit; here he talks about the
hypertrophy of parties and churches. It
is a hereditary Czech disease, he says.
‘Of this there cannot be the slightest doubt,
as Dr. Kramář used to say. And therefore,
I solemnly adjure you at this twelfth hour,
when great and terrible dangers confront us
on every hand, to urge our people to band
themselves together in a union of the whole
nation for the defence of our country. If
a religious bond be necessary for this union,
then let us be neither Protestants nor
Catholics nor Monists nor Abstainers, but
let us adopt a single, Slav, powerful, and
brotherly Orthodox faith, which will unite
us in one great Slav family and will secure
for us in these stormy times the protection
of a powerful Slav ruler. Those who will
not freely and whole-heartedly pay allegiance
to this glorious pan-Slav ideal should be
forced by Government authority, yea, and
by every form of compulsion permissible in
these exceptional circumstances, to abandon
their partisan and sectarian interests in
favour of the union of the whole nation.’
And so on. Signed ‘An Old Patriot.’ What
do you say to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Mr. Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that there’s something in it,”
Mr. Keval began; but just then the telephone
operator entered and said, “Munich on the
’phone. Some sort of civil or religious war
broke out in Germany yesterday. Is it
worth putting in the paper?”</p>

<h3>THE AUGSBURG IMBROGLIO</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>By</span> 11 p.m. the following telephonic communications
had been received at the office
of the <span class='it'>People’s Journal</span>:—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Czech Press Bureau</span>. <span class='it'>From Munich</span>, 12th inst.—According
to the Wolff Telegraph Agency, the demonstrations
in Augsburg yesterday led to bloodshed. Seventy
Protestants were killed. The demonstrations are still in
progress.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Czech Press Bureau</span>. <span class='it'>From Berlin</span>, 12th inst.—It is
officially announced that the number of killed and wounded
at Augsburg does not exceed twelve. The police are
maintaining order.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Special Message</span>. <span class='it'>From Lugano</span>, 12th inst.—We learn
from a reliable source that the number of victims at
Augsburg is over five thousand. Railway communication
with the north is suspended. The Bavarian Ministry is
in permanent session. The German Emperor has broken
off his hunting trip and is returning to Berlin.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Czech Press Bureau</span>. <span class='it'>Reuter</span>, 12th inst.—At 3 a.m.
to-day the Bavarian Government declared a Holy War
on Prussia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the following day Mr. Cyril Keval was
already in Bavaria. From his comparatively
trustworthy reports we make the following
excerpts:—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>At 6 p.m. on the 10th instant the Catholic workmen
in the Scholler lead-pencil factory at Augsburg gave the
Protestant foreman a beating, the provocation being some
dispute relating to the worship of the Virgin. Quiet
prevailed at night, but at 10 a.m. on the following day
the Catholic workmen came out in all departments
noisily demanding the discharge of all Protestant employees.
Scholler, the owner of the factory, was killed,
and two directors were stabbed. The clergy were
compelled by force to carry the monstrance at the head
of the procession. The Archbishop, Dr. Lenz, who came
out to pacify the demonstrators, was thrown into the
River Lech. The Social-Democratic leaders attempted
to speak, but were forced to take refuge in the synagogue.
At 3 p.m. the synagogue was blown up with dynamite.
While the looting of Jewish and Protestant shops went
on, accompanied by some shooting and numerous
conflagrations, the City Council carried unanimously
the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, and
issued an impassioned appeal to the Catholic nations of
the world to take up the sword in defence of the Holy
Catholic Faith. Upon the receipt of this news various
manifestos were issued in other Bavarian cities. In
Munich a Popular Assembly was held at 7 p.m., which
amid the wildest enthusiasm passed a resolution for the
secession of the Southern States from the German Empire.
The Munich Government wired Berlin that it was taking
over the administration. The Imperial Chancellor, Dr.
Wurm, immediately called on the Minister of War,
who ordered ten thousand bayonets to Bavaria from the
garrisons of Saxony and the Rhineland. At 1 a.m. these
troop trains were blown up on the line at the Bavarian
frontier, and machine-guns were turned upon the wounded.
At 3 a.m. the Munich Government, in alliance with the
Alpine provinces, decided to proclaim a Holy War on
the Lutherans.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It would seem that hopes of a peaceful solution of the
whole misunderstanding have not yet been abandoned
in Berlin. At this moment the Emperor is still delivering
his speech in Parliament, declaring that he knows neither
Catholics nor Protestants, but only Germans. The North
German forces are said to be concentrated along the
Erfurt-Gotha-Kassel line. The Catholic forces are
advancing in the general direction of Zwickau and Rudolfstadt,
meeting with no opposition but that of the civilian
population. The town of Greiz has been burned down
and the citizens either killed or dragged into slavery.
The reports of a great battle have not so far been confirmed.
Refugees from Bayreuth state that the firing
of heavy artillery could be heard from the north. The
railway station at Magdeburg is said to have been blown
up by the bombs of Bavarian airmen. Weimar is on fire.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Indescribable enthusiasm prevails here in Munich.
Attestation commissions are at work in all the schools;
crowds of volunteers wait as long as twenty hours in the
streets. The heads of twenty decapitated pastors are
exposed on the Rathaus. The Catholic clergy have to
serve mass day and night in overcrowded churches; the
Reverend Father Grosshube, who was also a member of
Parliament, died of exhaustion at the altar. Jews, Monists,
Abstinents, and other heretics have barricaded themselves
in their houses. Rosenheim, the banker, the oldest
member of the Jewish community, was publicly burned
at the stake this morning.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The Dutch and Danish ambassadors have asked for
their passports. The American representative has
lodged a protest against the disturbance of the peace;
on the other hand, the Italian Government has assured
Bavaria of its particularly benevolent neutrality.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Bands of recruits march through the streets carrying
flags with a white cross on a red ground, and shouting
“God wills it.” Ladies are entering the nursing service
and getting hospitals ready. Business houses are for the
most part closed. So is the Stock Exchange.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was on the 14th of February. On
the 15th fairly heavy fighting took place on
both banks of the Werre, the Protestant
forces yielding a little ground. On the same
day the first shots were also fired on the
Dutch-Belgian frontier. England ordered
the mobilization of the fleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 16th of February Italy granted
free passage to the Spanish army despatched
to the aid of the Bavarians. The Tyrolese
peasants, armed with scythes, attacked the
Helvetian Swiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 18th of February, the Anti-Pope
Martin cabled his blessing to the Bavarian
army. An indecisive battle took place at
Meiningen. Russia declared war on the
Polish Catholics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 19th: Ireland declared war on
England. An opposition Caliph made his
appearance at Broussa, and unfurled the
green banner of the Prophet. Mobilization
of the Balkan States, and massacres in
Macedonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 23rd: The North German front
pierced. General revolt in India. Proclamation
of a Holy War by the Moslems on
the Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 27th: The Greek-Italian war,
and the first encounters on Albanian soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 3rd: The Japanese fleet sailed
eastward against the United States of
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 15th: The Crusaders (Catholics)
took Berlin. Meanwhile the Union of
Protestant States was proclaimed at Stettin.
The German Emperor, Kaspar I, assumed
command in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 16th: A Chinese army, two
million strong, poured over the Siberian and
Manchurian frontiers. The army of the
Anti-Pope Martin took Rome by storm.
Pope Urban fled to Portugal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 18th: Spain demanded that the
Lisbon Government should deliver up Pope
Urban; refusal followed <span class='it'>ipso facto</span> by war
between Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 26th: The South American States
presented an ultimatum to the North American
Union, demanding the repeal of Prohibition
and the abolition of religious liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>March 27th: The Japanese fleet landed
troops in California and British Columbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On April 1st the world situation was
approximately as follows: In Central Europe
the great world-conflict between the Catholics
and Protestants was running its course.
The Protestant Union had forced back the
Crusaders out of Berlin, had got a firm hold
on Saxony, and had occupied even the neutral
territory of Czechoslovakia. The City of
Prague was, by a peculiar coincidence, under
the command of the Swedish Major-General
Wrangel, possibly a descendant of the general
of the same name who figured in the Thirty
Years’ War. On the other hand, the
Crusaders had made themselves masters of
Holland, which they had flooded by breaking
the dykes and letting in the sea, as well as
of Hanover and Holstein as far as Lübeck,
whence they were making inroads on Denmark.
No quarter was given in the fighting.
Cities were razed to the ground, the men
killed, and women up to the age of fifty
violated. But the first things destroyed
in every case were the enemy Karburators.
Contemporaries of these inordinately bloody
struggles assure us that supernatural powers
were fighting on both sides. Often it
seemed as though an invisible hand seized
hostile aircraft and dashed them to the
ground, or intercepted in its flight a fifty-four
centimetre projectile weighing a ton
and hurled it back upon its own ranks.
Particularly horrible were the scenes enacted
during the destruction of the Karburators.
As soon as the enemy position was occupied,
there ensued an invisible but desperate
struggle round the local Karburators. At
times it was like a cyclone which wrecked
and scattered the whole building in which an
atomic boiler stood, like someone blowing
on a heap of feathers. Bricks, timbers and
tiles flew round in wild confusion, and the
contest usually ended in a frightful explosion
which felled every tree and structure within
a radius of twelve kilometres and scooped
out a crater over two hundred metres deep.
The force of the detonation naturally varied
according to the size of the exploding
Karburator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suffocating gases spread over a radius of
three hundred kilometres, utterly blasting all
vegetation; however, as these creeping
clouds several times turned back upon their
own ranks—through the strategical intervention
of supernatural powers—this very
unreliable method of warfare was abandoned.
It was apparent that while the Absolute
attacked on one side, it also defended
itself on the other. It introduced unheard-of
weapons into warfare—earthquakes,
cyclones, showers of sulphur, inundations,
angels, pestilence, famines, plagues of locusts,
etc.—till there was no alternative but to alter
the art of military strategy altogether. Mass
attacks, permanent entrenchments, open
order, strong points, and such-like nonsense,
were abandoned; every soldier received a
knife, some cartridges, and some bombs, and
with these he went off on his own to kill any
soldier who wore on his breast a cross of a
different colour. It was not a matter of two
armies confronting each other. There was
simply a particular country which was the
battle-field, and there the two armies moved
about promiscuously, killing one another
off, man for man, until finally it became
clear to whom that country now belonged.
It was a terribly murderous method, to be
sure, but it had ultimately, in the long run,
a certain conclusiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the situation in Central Europe.
At the beginning of April the Protestant
armies were entering Austria and Bavaria by
way of Czechoslovakia, while the Catholics
were overrunning Denmark and Pomerania.
Holland, as already stated, had completely
vanished from the map of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Italy internal warfare was raging
between the parties of Urban and Martin:
meanwhile Sicily fell into the hands of the
Greek Evzones. The Portuguese occupied
Austria and Castile, but lost their
own Estramadura; in the South as a whole
the war was waged with quite exceptional
ferocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>England had been fighting on Irish soil
and then in the colonies. By the beginning
of April she held only the coastline of Egypt.
The other colonies had been lost, and the
settlers killed by the natives. With the
aid of the Arabian, Sudanese, and Persian
armies the Turks had overwhelmed the
entire Balkan region, and had made themselves
masters of Hungary, when the schism
broke out between the Shiahs and the Sunnis
on what was apparently a very important
question concerning Ali, the fourth Caliph.
Both sects pursued each other from Constantinople
to the Carpathians with a zeal
and bloodthirstiness which unfortunately
also vented itself upon the Christians. And
so in this part of Europe things were worse
than anywhere else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poland vanished, being wiped out of
existence by the Russian armies. The
Russian hosts then turned to face the Yellow
invasion which was sweeping northward and
westward. Meanwhile ten Japanese army
corps had been landed in North America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will notice that no mention has yet
been made of France, the chronicler having
reserved that country for Chapter XXIV.</p>

<h3>THE NAPOLEON OF THE<br/> MOUNTAIN BRIGADE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Bobinet</span>, if you please, Toni Bobinet, the
twenty-two-year-old lieutenant of mountain
artillery, attached to the garrison of
Annecy (Haute Savoie), but at present on
six weeks’ manœuvres on the Needles (Les
Aiguilles), from which on a clear day one
can see in the west the lakes of Annecy
and Geneva, and in the east the blunted
ridge of the Bonne Montagne and the
peaks of Mont Blanc—do you know your
way about now? Well, then, Lieutenant Toni
Bobinet sat on a boulder and tugged at his
tiny moustache, first because he was bored,
and secondly because he had read a newspaper
two weeks old right through for the
fifth time, and was now thinking things
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point the chronicler ought to
follow the meditations of the prospective
Napoleon, but in the meantime his glance
(the chronicler’s, that is) has slid along the
snow-covered slopes to the gorge of the
Arly, where the thaw has already set in,
and where his eye is caught and held by
the tiny little towns of Mégève, Flumet, and
Ugines, with their pointed churches looking
like toys. Ah, the memories of long-vanished
childhood! The castles in the air one reared
with one’s box of bricks!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Lieutenant Bobinet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
no. Let us abandon any attempt to psychologize
great men, to express the titanic
idea in the germ from which it sprang.
We are not equal to the task, and if we
were, we should perhaps be disappointed.
Just picture to yourself this little Lieutenant
Bobinet sitting on Les Aiguilles with
Europe falling into ruin all about him—a
battery of mountain guns in front of him,
and below him a miniature world which
could easily be shot to pieces from where he
sat. Imagine that he has just read in an
old copy of the Annecy <span class='it'>Moniteur</span> the leading
article in which some M. Babillard calls for
the strong hand of a helmsman who will
steer the good ship France out of the raging
storm toward new power and glory; and that
up there, at a height of over two thousand
metres, the air is pure and free from the
Absolute, so that one can think clearly and
freely. Picture all this, and you will understand
how it was that Lieutenant Bobinet,
sitting there on his rock, first grew very
thoughtful and then wrote his venerable,
wrinkled, white-haired mother a somewhat
confused letter, assuring her that “she would
soon be hearing of her Toni,” and that Toni
had “a magnificent idea.” After that he saw
to one thing and another, had a good night’s
sleep, and in the morning assembled all the
soldiers of his battery, deposed the incompetent
old captain, took possession of the
military post at Sallanches, declared war on
the Absolute with Napoleonic brevity, and
went to sleep again. The following day he
shot to pieces the Karburator in the bakery
at Thônes, occupied the railway station of
Bonneville, and seized the command at
Annecy, having by this time three thousand
men under him. Within a week he had
destroyed over two hundred Karburators and
was leading fifteen thousand bayonets and
sabres against Grenoble. He was proclaimed
commandant of Grenoble, and now
had a small army of forty thousand men at
his back, with which he descended into the
valley of the Rhone and busied himself in
painstakingly clearing the surrounding territory
of all atomic motors by means of his
long-range guns. On the road to Chambéry
he captured the Minister for War, who was
hurrying in his motor-car to put Bobinet
back in his place. The Minister for War
was so captivated and convinced by Bobinet’s
plans that he made him a General on the
following day. On April 1st the city of
Lyons was completely cleansed of every trace
of the Absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to this point Bobinet’s triumphant
progress had not been attended by bloodshed.
He met with his first opposition from ardent
Catholics beyond the Loire, and sanguinary
engagements took place. Fortunately for
Bobinet, many Frenchmen had remained
sceptics, even in communities completely
saturated with the Absolute, and indeed
showed themselves wildly fanatical in their
unbelief and rationalism. After cruel massacres
and new St. Bartholomew’s Eves
“les Bobinets” were welcomed everywhere
as liberators, and everywhere they went they
succeeded in pacifying the populace after
destroying all the Karburators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it befell that as early as July,
Parliament proclaimed that Toni Bobinet had
deserved well of his country, and raised him
to the dignity of First Consul with the
title of Marshal. France was consolidated.
Bobinet introduced State atheism; any sort
of religious demonstration was punishable by
court-martial with death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot refrain from mentioning a few
episodes in the great man’s career.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bobinet and his Mother.</span>—One day
Bobinet was holding council at Versailles
with his General Staff. As the day was hot,
he had taken his place by an open window.
Suddenly he noticed an aged woman in the
park, warming herself in the sun. Bobinet
at once interrupted Marshal Jollivet with a
cry of “Look, gentlemen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my mother!”
All present, even the most hardened generals,
were moved to tears by this demonstration of
filial affection.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bobinet and Love of Country.</span>—On one
occasion Bobinet was holding a military
review on the Champ de Mars in a downpour
of rain. While the heavy howitzers were
passing before him, an army motor ran into
a large puddle of water which spurted up and
bespattered Bobinet’s cloak. Marshal Jollivet
wished to punish the commander of the
unfortunate battery by reducing him in rank
on the spot. But Bobinet restrained him,
saying, “Let him alone, Marshal. After
all, this is the mud of France!”</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bobinet and the Old Pensioner.</span>—Bobinet
was once driving out incognito to
Chartres. On the way a tyre burst, and
while the chauffeur was putting on a new
one, a one-legged pensioner came up and
asked for alms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did this man lose his leg?”
asked Bobinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old pensioner related that he had lost
it while serving in Indo-China. He had a
poor old mother, and there were often days
when neither of them had a bite to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marshal, take this man’s name,” said
Bobinet, deeply affected. And sure enough
a week later there came a knock at the door
of the old pensioner’s hut; it was Bobinet’s
personal courier, who handed the hapless
cripple a packet “from the First Consul.”
Who can describe the surprise and delight
of the old soldier when upon opening
the packet he found inside it the <span class='it'>Bronze
Medal</span>!</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>Thanks to a character of such striking
qualities, it is not surprising that Bobinet
finally consented to gratify the fervent desire
of the whole nation, and on the 14th of
August proclaimed himself, amid universal
enthusiasm, Emperor of the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole world thus entered upon a
period which, though anything but peaceful,
was to be glorious in history. Every quarter
of the globe literally blazed with heroic
feats of arms. Seen from Mars, our earth
must certainly have shone like a star of the
first magnitude, from which the Martian
astronomers doubtless concluded that we
were still in a condition of glowing heat.
You can well believe that chivalrous France
and her representative, the Emperor Toni
Bobinet, did not play a minor rôle. Perhaps,
too, such remnants of the Absolute as had
not yet escaped into space were at work here,
awakening a spirit of exaltation and fervour.
At any rate, when the great Emperor proclaimed,
two days after his coronation, that
the hour had come for France to cover the
whole earth with her banner, a unanimous
roar of enthusiasm gave him his answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobinet’s plan was the following:—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>1. To occupy Spain, and by taking
Gibraltar secure the key to the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. To occupy the Danube valley as far
as Budapest as the key to the interior of
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. To occupy Denmark as the key to the
North Sea area.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And since territorial keys have usually to
be smeared with blood, France fitted out
three armies which won for her tremendous
glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth army occupied Asia Minor as
the key to the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth army made itself master of the
mouth of the St. Lawrence as the key to
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sixth army went down in the naval
battle off the English coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seventh army laid siege to Sebastopol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By New Year’s Eve, 1944, the Emperor
Bobinet had all his keys in the pocket of his
artillery breeches.</p>

<h3>THE SO-CALLED GREATEST WAR</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is a foible of our human nature that when
we have an extremely unpleasant experience,
it gives us a peculiar satisfaction if it is “the
biggest” of its disagreeable kind that has
happened since the world began. During a
heat wave, for instance, we are very pleased
if the papers announce that it is “the highest
temperature reached since the year 1881,”
and we feel a little resentment towards the
year 1881 for having gone us one better.
Or if our ears are frozen till all the skin
peels off, it fills us with a certain happiness
to learn that “it was the hardest frost
recorded since 1786.” It is just the same
with wars. The war in progress is either
the most righteous or the bloodiest, or the
most successful, or the longest, since such
and such a time; any superlative whatever
always affords us the proud satisfaction of
having been through something extraordinary
and record-breaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the war which lasted from February
12, 1944 to the autumn of 1953, was in all
truthfulness and without any exaggeration
(on my honour!) the Greatest War. Do
not let us rob those who lived through it of
this one solitary and well-earned satisfaction.
198,000,000 men took part in the fighting,
and all but thirteen of them fell. I could
give you figures by which accountants and
statisticians have attempted to illustrate
these enormous losses—for instance, how
many thousand kilometres the bodies
would stretch if laid one beside the other,
and for how many hours an express train
would have to run if the bodies were put on
the line in place of sleepers; or if the index
fingers of all the fallen were cut off and
put in sardine-tins, how many hundred
goods trucks could be filled with such a
load, and so on. But I have a poor memory
for figures, and I don’t want to cheat you
out of a single miserable statistical truckload.
So I repeat that it was the greatest
war since the creation of the world, whether
you take into consideration the loss of life
or the extent of the theatre of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again the present chronicler has to
excuse himself for not caring very much for
descriptions of events on the grand scale.
Perhaps he ought to relate how the war
swung from the Rhine to the Euphrates,
from Korea to Denmark, from Lugano to
Haparanda, and so forth. Instead of this,
he would far rather depict the arrival of
the Bedouins in their white burnouses at
Geneva, and how they came galloping in
with the heads of their enemies stuck on
their six-foot spears; or the love adventures
of a French <span class='it'>poilu</span> in Thibet; the
cavalcades of Russian Cossacks that crossed
the Sahara; the nightly encounters of
Macedonian <span class='it'>comitadjis</span> with Senegalese sharpshooters
on the shores of the lakes of
Finland. As you see, there is the greatest
diversity of material. Bobinet’s victorious
regiments flew, so to speak, in one dazzling
swoop in the footprints of Alexander the
Great across India to China; but meanwhile
the Yellow invasion swept over Siberia
and Russia into France and Spain, thus
cutting off from their native land the
Moslems who were operating in Sweden.
The Russian regiments, retreating before the
overwhelming numerical superiority of the
Chinese, found themselves in North Africa,
where Sergei Nikolayevich Zlocin established
his Czardom. He was soon murdered, however,
because his Bavarian generals conspired
against his Prussian hetmans, and Sergei
Fyodorovich Zlosin thereupon ascended the
Imperial throne in Timbuctoo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Czechoslovakia was held by the Swedes,
French, Turks, Russians and Chinese in
succession; each of these invasions killed
off the native population to the last man.
In the course of those years services were
held, or Mass celebrated, in the Church of
St. Vitus by a pastor, a solicitor, an Imam,
an Archimandrite and a bonze, none of them
enjoying any permanent success. The only
gratifying change was that the Stavovsky
Theatre was invariably full, being used for
the purposes of an army store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Japanese had thrust the Chinese
out of Eastern Europe in the year 1951
there arose for a brief space a new Middle
Kingdom (as the Chinese call their native
land), and chance willed that it should fall
precisely within the frontiers of the old
empire of Austria-Hungary. Once again
an aged ruler dwelt in Schönbrunn, the old
mandarin Jaja Wir Weana, one hundred and
six years old, “to whose consecrated head
rejoicing nations turn their eyes with childlike
love,” as the <span class='it'>Wiener Mittagszeitung</span>
assured its readers daily. The official language
was Chinese, which at one sweep did
away with all nationalistic rivalries. The
State god was Buddha. The stubborn
Catholics of Bohemia and Moravia moved
out of the country, or became the victims
of Chinese dragonades and confiscations, by
which the number of national martyrs was
increased to a remarkable extent. On the
other hand, several prominent and prudent
Czech patriots were exalted to mandarin
rank by Most Gracious Decree as a reward
for their enlightened adaptability. The
Chinese administration inaugurated many
new and progressive measures, such as the
issuing of tickets in place of provisions; but
the Middle Kingdom fell to pieces very early,
as the supply of lead necessary for munitions
ran out, and all authority thereupon collapsed.
A few of those Chinese who were
not killed remained in the country even in
the ensuing period of peace, and for the
most part occupied high Government positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the Emperor Bobinet,
now residing in India, at Simla, learnt that
an Amazon Empire of women existed in the
hitherto unexplored river-territory of the
Irawaddy, Salwin, and Mekong. He set
out for that region at once with his Old
Guard, but never again returned. According
to one version he married and settled
there. According to another, Amalia, the
Queen of the Amazons, cut off his head in
battle and flung it into a skin filled with
blood, saying, “Satia te sanguine, quem
tantum sitisti.” This second version is
doubtless the milder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end Europe became the theatre of
furious struggles between the black race,
which came pouring out of the interior of
Africa, and the Mongolian race. The happenings
of those two years are best passed
over in silence. The last traces of civilization
vanished. For instance, the bears
multiplied on Hradčany to such an extent
that the last inhabitants of Prague destroyed
all the bridges, even the Charles Bridge, to
save the right bank of the Vltava from these
bloodthirsty beasts. The population shrank
to an insignificant little group; the Vyšehrad
Chapter died out both on the male and
female side; the championship match between
the Sparta Club and the Victoria
Zizkov was witnessed by only one hundred
and ten people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other continents the situation was
no better. North America, after the fearful
ravages of the murderous struggles
between the Prohibitionists and the “Wets,”
had become a Japanese colony. In South
America there had been by turns an Empire
of Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Brandenburg and
Patagonia. In Australia, an Ideal State had
been formed, immediately after the downfall
of England, which transformed this promising
land into an uninhabited desert. In
Africa over two million white men had been
eaten. The negroes of the Congo basin had
hurled themselves upon Europe, while the
rest of Africa was in the throes of the fluctuating
conflicts of its one hundred and eighty-six
different Emperors, Sultans, Kings, Chiefs
and Presidents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is history, you see. Each one of
those hundred millions of warring pigmies
had had his childhood, his loves, his plans;
he was often afraid, he was frequently a hero,
but usually he was tired to death and would
have been glad to lie down on his bed in
peace; and if he died, it was certainly
against his will. And from all of this, one
can take only a handful of arid events: a
battle here or there, losses so and so, result
this or that—and, after all, the result never
brought about any real decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore I say: Do not rob the people
of that time of their only boast—that what
they went through was the Greatest War.
We, however, know that in a few decades
we shall succeed in arranging an even greater
war, for in this respect also the human race
is progressing ever upward and on.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch26'>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF HRADEC<br/> KRALOVE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> present chronicler now appeals to
August Sedlaček, Joseph Pekař, and other
authorities on the writing of history, in
support of the statement that a vast amount
of historical knowledge can be drawn from
purely local happenings. They mirror world
events as in a drop of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, the drop of water entitled
Hradec Králové is memorable to the
chronicler because he used to race about in
it like a tiny organism, as an infusorian of
the grammar school there, and not surprisingly
thought it the universe; but
enough of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Greatest War found Hradec Králové
armed with only a single Karburator, and that
was in the brewery still standing to this day
behind the Church of the Holy Spirit, which
is next to the residence of the Canons.
Perhaps it was this hallowed environment
which reacted on the Absolute in such a
way that it began to brew a plentiful and
ardently Catholic beer and thereby brought
the citizens of Hradec to a condition in
which the deceased Bishop Brynych would
have taken sincere pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Hradec Králové is too close
to the railway, and so it very soon fell into
the hands of the Prussians, who in their
Lutheran fury destroyed the Karburator in
the brewery. Nevertheless, mindful of its
historical continuity, Hradec maintained an
agreeable religious temperature, especially
when the enlightened Bishop Linda took
over the diocese. And even when the
Bobinets, the Turks, and the Chinese came,
Hradec did not lose its proud consciousness
that (i) it had the best amateur theatre in
all Eastern Bohemia; (ii) it had the tallest
steeple in Eastern Bohemia; (iii) the pages
of its local history contained the greatest
battle in Eastern Bohemia. Heartened by
these reflections, Hradec Králové withstood
the most terrible trials of the Greatest War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Mandarin Empire collapsed,
the city was under the government of that
circumspect Burgomaster, Mr. Skocdopole.
Amid the prevailing anarchy his administration
was blessed with comparative peace,
thanks to the wise counsels of Bishop Linda
and the Worshipful City Fathers. But one
fine day there came to the city a poor tailor,
Hampl by name; he was, Heaven help us, a
native of Hradec, but he had knocked about
the world ever since childhood and had even
served with the Foreign Legion in Algeria—in
fact, an adventurer. He marched with
Bobinet’s troops to the conquest of India,
but deserted near Baghdad, and had slipped
like a needle through the lines of the Bashi-Bazouks,
French, Swedes and Chinese, back
to his native city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, this Hampl, the little tailor, had
caught a whiff of Bobinetism, and as soon
as he got back to Hradec he thought of
nothing but how he could seize command.
Stitching away at clothes didn’t suit him any
longer, thank you; so he began agitating
and criticizing, saying that one thing and
another was not right, that the whole
City Council was under the thumb of the
parsons, and what about that money in the
Savings Bank, and Mr. Skocdopole was an
incapable old dodderer, and what not.
Wars, unfortunately, bring with them a
demoralization and a weakening of all
authority, and so Hampl found several
followers and with their assistance founded
the Social-Revolutionary Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day in June friend Hampl summoned
a Popular Assembly in the Little
Square, and standing on the fountain, shouted
out, among other things, that the people
categorically demanded that Skocdopole,
that scoundrel, reactionary, and lackey of
the Bishop, should resign the office of
Burgomaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In answer to this, Mr. Skocdopole put up
posters stating that he, as the lawfully
elected Burgomaster, need take orders from
no one, least of all from an interloper and a
deserter; that in the present times of unrest
it was impossible to hold a fresh election,
and that our clear-sighted citizens were well
aware .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and so forth. This was just what
Hampl was waiting for to carry out his
coup <span class='it'>à la Bobinet</span>. He came out of his
house on the Little Square, waving a red
flag, with two boys behind him beating drums
with all their might. In this fashion he
marched around the Great Square, paused a
while in front of the Bishop’s palace, and
then marched off with rolling drums to the
field near the Orlice river called the “Little
Mill.” There he stuck his standard into
the ground and, seated on a drum, wrote out
his declaration of war. Then he sent the
two boys into the city with orders to beat
their drums and read out his proclamation
at every corner; it ran as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In the name of His Highness the Emperor Bobinet</span>,
I hereby summon the royal City of Hradec Králové to
place the keys of the city gates in my hands. If this is
not done by sunset, I will put into effect the military
measures I have prepared and will attack the city at
dawn with artillery, cavalry and bayonets. I will spare
the lives and property only of those who join my camp
at the “Little Mill” by dawn at latest, bringing all their
usable weapons, and take the oath of allegiance to His
Majesty the Emperor Bobinet. Parlementaires will be
shot. The Emperor does not parley.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>General Hampl.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This proclamation was read out and caused
a considerable commotion, especially when
the sexton of the Church of the Holy
Spirit began to ring the tocsin in the White
Tower. Mr. Skocdopole called on Bishop
Linda, who, however, laughed at his fears.
Then he summoned an extraordinary meeting
of the City Council, at which he proposed
that the keys of the city gates should be
given up to General Hampl. It was then
ascertained that there were no such keys in
existence; a few locks and keys of historical
interest which used to repose in the City
Museum had been carried off by the Swedes.
Amid these perplexities night came on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the afternoon, but more particularly
towards evening, people were trickling along
the pleasant lanes towards the Little Mill.
“Oh, well,” they said to each other when
they met, “I thought I might as well
come along too, just to have a look at that
crazy fellow’s camp.” When they arrived
at the Little Mill, they beheld the meadows
already crowded with people, and Hampl’s
aide-de-camp standing beside the two drums
administering the oath of allegiance to the
Emperor Bobinet. Here and there bonfires
were burning, with shadowy figures flitting
about them: in short, it all looked very
picturesque. Several people went back to
Hradec visibly depressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By night the sight was even finer. Skocdopole,
the Burgomaster, crept up the White
Tower after midnight, and there to the
east along the Orlice river hundreds of fires
were burning, thousands of figures were
moving about in the firelight, which cast a
blood-red glow over the countryside. It
looked as though entrenchments were being
made. The Burgomaster came down from
the tower deeply perturbed. It was evident
that General Hampl’s menaces regarding his
military strength had not been exaggerated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dawn General Hampl emerged from
the wooden mill, where he had sat up all
night studying the plans of the city. Several
thousand men, all of them in civilian clothes,
but for the most part armed, had drawn
themselves up in fours; women, old men,
and children thronged around them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forward,” cried Hampl, and at the
same instant the trumpets rang out in the
brass band from Mr. Cerveny’s world-famous
wind-instrument works, and to the
tune of a merry march (“The Girls along
the Highway”) Hampl’s forces advanced
upon the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Hampl brought his troops to a
halt before the city and sent forward a
trumpeter and a herald with the demand
that all non-combatants should leave their
houses. No one came out, however. The
houses were empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Little Square was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Great Square was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole city was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Hampl twirled his moustache and
made his way to the City Hall. It was open.
He entered the Council Chamber. He took
his seat in the Burgomaster’s Chair. Sheets
of paper were lying spread out in front of
him on the green cloth, and on each of them
these words had been written in a beautiful
hand:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of His Majesty the
Emperor Bobinet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Hampl stepped to the window
and cried: “Soldiers, the battle is ended.
You have crushed with the mailed fist the
clerical tyranny of the Council clique. An
era of progress and freedom has dawned for
our beloved city. Return now, all of you,
to your homes. You have played your
part nobly. <span class='it'>Nazdar!</span> (Good luck go
with you!)”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nazdar!</span>” responded the army, and
dispersed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of Hampl’s warriors (they came to
be called simply Hampelmen) went back
home to the Burgomaster’s house; he had
shouldered a rifle left behind by a Chinese
soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was that Hampl became Mayor.
It has to be acknowledged that amid the
prevailing anarchy his prudent administration
also was blessed with comparative peace,
thanks to the wise counsels of Bishop Linda
and the Worshipful City Fathers.</p>

<h3>A CORAL ISLAND IN THE<br/> PACIFIC</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Well</span>, I’ll go to blazes,” said Captain
Trouble, “if that lanky fellow over there
isn’t their leader!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Jimmy,” remarked G. H. Bondy.
“He used to work here at one time. I
thought he was quite tame by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil must have owed me something,”
the Captain growled, “or I shouldn’t
have had to land here on this wretched .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Hereheretua!!! Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” said G. H. Bondy, laying his
gun on the table on the veranda. “Is it
the same as this in other places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so,” boomed Captain
Trouble. “Not far off, on Rawaiwai, Captain
Barker and his whole crew were eaten.
And on Mangai they had a banquet on three
millionaires like yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sutherland Bros.?” asked Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so. And on Starbuck Island
they roasted a High Commissioner. It was
that fat MacDeon; you know him, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know him?” shouted the
Captain. “How long have you been here,
man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my ninth year,” said Mr. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you might well have known him,”
the Captain said. “So you’ve been here
nine years? Business, eh? Or a little
home of refuge, is it? On account of your
nerves, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mr. Bondy. “You see, I
foresaw that they were all going to be at
loggerheads over there, so I got out of the
way. I thought that here I would find
more peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha, peace! You don’t know our big
black fellows! There’s a bit of a war going
on here all the time, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh well,” G. H. Bondy demurred,
“there really was peace here. They’re
quite decent chaps, these Papuans or whatever
you call them. It’s only just recently
that they’ve begun to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rather disagreeable.
I don’t quite understand them.
What are they really after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing special,” said the Captain.
“They only want to eat us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they as hungry as all that?” asked
Bondy in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I think they do it more
out of religion. It’s one of their religious
rites, don’t you see? Something like communion,
I take it. It takes them that way
every now and then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed,” said Mr. Bondy thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone has his hobby,” growled the
Captain. “The local hobby here is to eat
up the stranger and dry his head in smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, smoke it as well?” Mr. Bondy
exclaimed with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s not done till after you’re
dead,” said the Captain consolingly. “They
cherish the smoked head as a souvenir.
Have you ever seen those dried heads
they’ve got in the Ethnographical Museum
at Auckland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Bondy. “I don’t think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I’d look very attractive if I
were smoked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a bit too fat for it,” observed
the Captain, inspecting him critically. “It
doesn’t make so very much difference to a
thin man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bondy still looked anything but tranquil.
He sat droopingly on the veranda of his
bungalow on the coral island of Hereheretua,
which he had purchased just before the
outbreak of the Greatest War. Captain
Trouble was glowering suspiciously at the
thicket of mangroves and bananas which
surrounded the bungalow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many natives are there on the
island?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a hundred and twenty,” said
G. H. Bondy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how many of us are there in the
bungalow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven, counting the Chinese cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain sighed and looked out to sea.
His ship, the <span class='it'>Papeete</span>, lay there at anchor;
but to get to her he would have to go along
a narrow path between the mangroves, and
this did not precisely seem advisable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, sir,” he said after a while,
“what are they squabbling about over there,
anyway? Some boundary or other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Less than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Colonies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even less than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Commercial treaties?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Only about the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The absolute truth. You see, every
nation insists that it has the absolute truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm,” grunted the Captain. “What is
it, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. A sort of human passion.
You’ve heard, haven’t you, that in Europe
yonder, and everywhere in fact, a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
God, you know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came into the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did hear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what it’s all about, don’t
you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t understand, old man. If
you ask me, the true God would put things
right in the world. The one they’ve got
can’t be the true and proper God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” said G. H. Bondy
(obviously pleased at being able to talk for
once with an independent and experienced
human being), “I assure you that it <span class='it'>is</span> the
true God. But I’ll tell you something else.
This true God is far too big.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do indeed. He is infinite. That’s
just where the trouble lies. You see,
everyone measures off a certain amount of
Him and then thinks it is the entire God.
Each one appropriates a little fringe or
fragment of Him and then thinks he possesses
the whole of Him. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha,” said the Captain. “And then
gets angry with everyone else who has a
different bit of Him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. In order to convince himself
that God is wholly his, he has to go and
kill all the others. Just for that very
reason, because it means so much to him to
have the whole of God and the whole of the
truth. That’s why he can’t bear anyone
else to have any other God or any other
truth. If he once allowed that, he would
have to admit that he himself has only a few
wretched metres or gallons or sackloads of
divine truth. You see, suppose Dash were
convinced that it was tremendously important
that only Dash’s underwear should be
the best on earth, he would have to burn
his rival, Blank, and all Blank’s underwear.
But Dash isn’t so silly as that in the matter
of underwear; he is only as silly as that in
the matter of religion or English politics.
If he believed that God was something as
substantial and essential as underwear, he
would allow other people to provide themselves
with Him just as they pleased. But
he hasn’t sufficient commercial confidence
in Him; and so he forces Dash’s God or
Dash’s Truth on everybody with curses,
wars, and other unreliable forms of advertisement.
I am a business man and I understand
competition, but this sort of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” interrupted Captain
Trouble, and aimed a shot into the mangrove
thicket. “There, I think that’s one less of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died for his faith,” whispered Bondy
dreamily. “You have forcibly restrained
him from devouring me. He fell for the
national ideal of cannibalism. In Europe
people have been devouring each other from
time immemorial out of idealism. You are
a decent man, Captain, but it’s quite possible
that you’d devour me on behalf of any
fundamental principle of navigation. I’ve
lost confidence even in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite right,” the Captain
grumbled. “When I look at you, I feel
that I’m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a violent anti-Semite. I know.
That doesn’t matter, I had myself baptized.
But do you know, Captain, what’s got hold
of those black idiots? The night before
last they fished out of the sea a Japanese
atomic torpedo. They’ve set it up over
there under the coco-nut palms, and now
they are bowing down before it. Now they
have a God of their own. That’s why
they must devour us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>War-cries sounded from the mangrove
thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hear them?” muttered the
Captain. “On my soul, I’d rather .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go
through the geometry examination all over
again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” Bondy whispered. “Couldn’t
we go over to their religion? As far as I’m
concerned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a gun boomed out from
the <span class='it'>Papeete</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain uttered a low cry of joy.</p>

<h3>AT SEVEN COTTAGES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>And</span> while the world shook with the clash
of armies, while the boundaries of States
writhed to and fro like earth-worms, and
the whole earth was crumbling into a field
of ruins, old Mrs. Blahous was peeling her
potatoes in Seven Cottages, Grandfather
Blahous was sitting on the doorstep smoking
beech-leaves, and their neighbour, Mrs.
Prouzova, was leaning on the fence, repeating
meditatively, “Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, yes,” returned Blahous after a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, yes,” observed Mrs. Blahous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s how ’tis,” Mrs. Prouzova
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what’s the use?” said Grandfather
Blahous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s it,” added Mrs. Blahous,
peeling another potato.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say the Italians got a good hiding,”
Blahous announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the Turks, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I suppose that’ll be the end of
the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you mean? The Prussians’ll
start off now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, against us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Against the French, they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens above, everything will be
dear again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say that the Swiss wrote not long
ago that the others might give it up soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Why, the day before yesterday
I paid fifteen hundred crowns for a candle.
I tell you, Blahous, it was one of those
miserable things only fit for the stable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you mean to say it cost you fifteen
hundred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not far off. There’s a rise for you,
friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’d ever have thought it? Fifteen
hundred!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could get a fine candle for two
hundred at one time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, auntie, but that’s years ago. Why,
even an egg only cost five hundred in those
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you could get a pound of butter
for three thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And lovely butter, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And boots for eight thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, Mrs. Blahous, things were
cheap in those days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only it was all over and done
with!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence. Old Blahous rose,
straightened his back, and went into the
yard for a wisp of straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what’s the use?” he said, unscrewing
the head of his pipe in order to pull
the straw through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t half smelling before,” remarked
Mrs. Blahous, full of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smelling,” said Blahous, nodding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can it help smelling? There’s no
tobacco left in the world now. The last
packet I had was the one my son the
Professor sent me—let me see, that was in
’49, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was just four years ago come
Easter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So ’twas,” said Grandfather Blahous.
“We’re getting an old man now. Very,
very old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what I want to know,” began Mrs.
Prouzova, “is what’s all this awful to-do
about nowadays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What to-do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this war, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, yes, Heaven knows what it’s about,”
said Blahous, blowing down his pipe until it
gurgled. “That’s what nobody knows, aunt.
They say it’s about religion—that’s what
they tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of religion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ours or the Swiss—nobody knows
which. It’s so as there’ll be only one
religion, they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we used to have only one religion
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But other places had a different one,
aunt. They say there was orders from
above that there must be only one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of orders? Where from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows. They say there were
once machines that had religion inside them.
It was hidden in a sort of long boiler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what were the boilers for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows. Just a sort of boilers.
And they say that God appeared to people
to make them believe. There was a lot
in those days, aunt, that didn’t believe.
One has to believe in something; what’s
the use? If people had only believed,
God wouldn’t have appeared to them. So
it was only their godlessness that made Him
come into the world, see, aunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes, but what did this awful war
begin for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows. People say that the
Chinese or the Turks began it. They say
that they brought their own God with them
in those boilers. They’re supposed to
be terrible religious, the Turks and the
Chinese. And so they wanted us to believe
the way they did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, nobody knows. If you ask
me, the Prussians started it. And the
Swedes, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, Lord!” lamented Mrs. Prouzova.
“And the prices things are now! Fifteen
hundred for a candle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what I say,” maintained old
Blahous, “is the Jews started the war so
as to make money out of it. That’s what
I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could do with some rain,” observed
Mrs. Blahous. “The potatoes are far too
small. Like nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my belief,” Blahous went on, “that
people just invented that about the Lord
God, so as to have someone to blame things
on. That was all made up. They wanted
a war and they wanted an excuse. It was
all a put-up job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows. What I say is, it was
all fixed up with the Pope and the Jews and
the whole lot of them. Those .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='sc'>Kalburators</span>!” shouted Grandfather
Blahous, in great excitement. “I’d like
to say it to their faces! Why, did anybody
need a new Lord God? The old one was
good enough for us country people. There
was just enough of Him, and He was good,
and honest and upright. He didn’t show
himself to anybody, but we had peace
instead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you asking for your eggs,
Prouzova?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m getting two thousand each at
present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say they’re asking three in
Trutnov.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I tell you,” declared old Blahous
vehemently, “it was bound to come. People
were cross with each other even then. Why,
your husband that’s dead now, Prouzova,
God rest his soul, was a spiritualist or
medium or something in those days. And
one time I said to him just in fun, ‘I
say, Prouza, you might call back that evil
spirit that’s just escaped from me.’ And he
lost his temper, and from that day to the
day of his death he never spoke a word to
me again. Yet he was my neighbour, mind
you, aunt. And look at Tony Vlcek. He
always swore by those foxfates that you
fertilize with, and if anyone didn’t believe in
them, he’d keep on going for him like mad.
And my son, the Professor, tells me it’s
the same wherever you go. If anyone sets
his mind on anything, he must have everybody
else believe in it. And he won’t let
anyone alone. That’s how it’s all come
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Aunt Prouzova, yawning.
“What’s the use of it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes,” sighed Mrs. Blahous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way things are in this world,”
added Mrs. Prouzova.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you women would like to go on
cackling all day long,” Grandfather Blahous
concluded peevishly, and tottered off into the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the earth shook with the clash
of armies, and thinkers in every camp confidently
asserted that “a brighter day was
dawning.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch29'>CHAPTER XXIX</h1></div>

<h3>THE LAST BATTLE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the autumn of 1953 the Greatest War
was drawing to a close. There were no
armies left. The armies of occupation, cut
off for the most part from their homes, were
dwindling away and gradually vanishing like
water in the sand. Self-appointed generals
marched from town to town, or rather from
heap to heap of ruins, at the head of five
men, one a drummer, one a thief, one a
schoolboy, one a man with a gramophone,
and one of whom nobody knew anything.
They went about collecting contributions
or arranging benefit performances “in aid
of the wounded and their widows and
orphans.” No one knew by now how
many warring camps there were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amid this universal and indescribable collapse
the Greatest War drew to its close. The
end came so unexpectedly that no one nowadays
can tell just where the last so-called
decisive battle was fought. Historians are
still at variance as to which engagement
marked the close and extinction of the world-conflagration.
Certain of them (such as
Dührich, Assbridge, and more particularly
Moroni) are inclined to the view that it was
the battle of Lintz. In these extensive
operations sixty soldiers were engaged, representing
eleven hostile camps. The conflict
broke out in the large saloon of the Rose
Inn, the immediate cause being the waitress
Hilda (as a matter of fact it was Marena
Ruzickova of Novy Bydzov). Giuseppe, the
Italian, proved victorious and carried Hilda
off; but since she ran away next day with a
Czech called Vaclav Hruska, this too was
not a decisive battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The historian Usinski records a similar
battle at Gorochovky, Leblond a skirmish
at Les Batignolles, and Van Goo a fight
near Nieuport; but it would seem that local
patriotism influenced them more directly than
genuinely historical motives. In short, no
one knows which was the last battle of the
Greatest War. Nevertheless, it can be determined
with considerable certitude from
documents that are striking in their agreement,
i.e. the series of prophecies that
appeared before the Greatest War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For example, a prophecy printed in
Swabian characters had been preserved since
1845, foretelling that in a hundred years
“terrible times will come, and many armed
men will fall in battle,” but that “in a
hundred months <span class='it'>thirteen</span> nations would meet
in the field <span class='it'>under a birch-tree</span>, and slaughter
each other in a desperate struggle,” which
would be followed by fifty years of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1893 the Turkish prophetess
Wali Schön (?) predicted that “five times
twelve years would pass ere peace would
reign over the whole world; in that year
<span class='it'>thirteen</span> emperors would make war upon each
other and would meet in battle <span class='it'>under a birch-tree</span>.
Then there would be peace, such a
peace as there had never been before and
never would be again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vision of a certain negress in Massachusetts
is also quoted, dating from 1909,
when she beheld “a black monster with two
horns, a yellow monster with three horns,
and a red monster with eight horns, fighting
<span class='it'>under a tree</span> (birch-tree?) until their blood
besprinkled the whole world.” It is interesting
to note that the total number of horns
is thirteen, apparently symbolical of the
thirteen nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1920 the Very Reverend Dr. Arnold
foretold that “there would be a great
Twenty Years’ War in which the whole
world would be involved. One great Emperor
would perish in that war, three great
Empires would fall, ninety-nine capital cities
would be destroyed, and the last battle of
that war would be the last battle of the
century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the same year belongs “The Vision of
Jonathan” (printed in Stockholm): “War
and pestilence will lay waste nine-and-ninety
countries, and nine-and-ninety kingdoms will
vanish and rise again. The last battle will
last nine-and-ninety hours, and will be so
bloody that all the victors will be able to
find room in the shade of one <span class='it'>birch-tree</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A German popular prophecy dating from
1923 speaks of the battle on the Birkenfeld
(<span class='it'>Birch field</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than two hundred similar prophetic
documents of the period between 1845 and
1944 have been preserved. In forty-eight
of these the number “thirteen” occurs; in
seventy of them the “birch-tree” appears;
in fifteen merely the “tree.” It may therefore
be concluded that the last battle took
place in the neighbourhood of a birch-tree.
Who took part in the struggle we do not
know, but there were altogether only thirteen
men left alive out of the various armies, and
they presumably lay down after the battle in
the shade of a birch-tree. That moment saw
the end of the Greatest War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, however, possible that the “birch”
is brought in symbolically, instead of a place-name.
There are one hundred and seven
places in the country of the Czechs alone
containing the Czech word for birch, such
as Brezany, Brezovice, and Brezolupy. Then
there is the German <span class='it'>Birke</span> and names like
Birkenberg, Birkenfeld, Birkenhaid, Birkenhammer,
Birkicht, Birkental, etc.; or the
English Birkenhead, Birchington, Birchanger,
and so on; or the French Boulainvilliers,
Boulay, etc. Thus the number of
towns, villages, and localities where the last
battle in all probability took place is narrowed
down to a few thousand (as long as we confine
ourselves to Europe, which certainly has
a prior claim to the Last Battle). Individual
scientific research will establish where
it occurred. Who won it cannot possibly
be determined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps after all—the fancy is alluring—there
did stand near the scene of the last
act of the world-tragedy a slender silvery
birch. Perhaps a lark sang above the
battle-field and a white butterfly fluttered
over the heads of the combatants. And
look, by this time there is hardly anyone
left to kill! It is a hot October day, and
one hero after another steps aside, turns his
back upon the battle-field, eases himself, and
lies down longing for peace in the shadow
of the birch-tree. At last the whole thirteen
of them are lying there, all the survivors of
the Last Battle. One lays his weary head
on his neighbour’s boots, another rests his
on the first man’s back, undisturbed by
his breathing. The last thirteen soldiers
left in the world are asleep beneath a
birch-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards evening they waken, look at each
other with suspicion, and reach for their
weapons. And then one of them—history
will never learn his name—says, “Oh, damn
it, boys, let’s chuck it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are, mate,” says the second
man with relief, laying aside his weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us a bit of bacon then, fathead,”
the third one asks with a certain gentleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth man returns, “Crikey, I
could do with a smoke. Hasn’t anybody
got a——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s clear off, boys,” urges the fifth.
“We’re not going to have any more of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you a cigarette,” says the
sixth, “but you’ll have to give me a bit
of bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going home, boys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think of
it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home,” the seventh one cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your old woman expecting you?”
the eighth man asks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, it’s six years since I slept in
a proper bed,” sighs the ninth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a mug’s game it was, lads!”
says the tenth man, spitting disgustedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was that!” the eleventh replies, “but
we’ve done with it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve done with it,” repeats the twelfth
man. “We’re not such fools. Let’s go
home, mates!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I’m glad it’s all over,” concludes
the thirteenth, turning over to lie on the
other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such, one can well imagine, was the
end of the Greatest War.</p>

<h3>THE END OF EVERYTHING</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Many</span> years went by. Brych the stoker,
now the proprietor of a locksmith’s business,
was sitting in the Damohorsky tavern,
reading a copy of the <span class='it'>People’s Journal</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The liver sausages will be ready in a
minute,” announced the landlord, emerging
from the kitchen. And bless me if it
wasn’t old Jan Binder, who used to own
the merry-go-round. He had grown fat
and no longer wore his striped jersey;
nevertheless it was he!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no hurry,” Mr. Brych answered
slowly. “Father Jost hasn’t turned up yet.
Nor Rejzek either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And—how is Mr. Kuzenda getting
along?” Jan Binder inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you know. He’s not very
grand. He’s one of the best men breathing,
Mr. Binder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, indeed,” assented the innkeeper.
“I don’t know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Brych .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what
about taking him a few of the liver sausages
with my compliments? They’re first class,
Mr. Brych, and if you’d be so kind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, with pleasure, Mr. Binder. He’ll
be delighted to think you remember him.
Of course I will. With pleasure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praised be the Lord!” came a voice
from the doorway, and Canon Jost stepped
into the room, his cheeks ruddy with the
cold, and hung up his hat and fur coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, your Reverence,” responded
Mr. Brych. “We’ve waited for
you—we’ve waited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Jost pursed his lips contentedly
and rubbed his stiffened hands. “Well, sir,
what’s in the papers, what have they got to
say to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just reading this: ‘The President
of the Republic has appointed that youthful
savant, Dr. Blahous, Lecturer at the University,
to be Assistant Professor.’ You
remember, Canon, it’s that Blahous who
once wrote an article about Mr. Kuzenda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha, aha,” said Father Jost, wiping his
little spectacles. “I know, I know, the
atheist. They are a lot of infidels at the
University. And you’re another, Mr.
Brych.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, his Reverence will pray for us, I
know,” said Mr. Binder. “He’ll want us
in heaven to make up the card-party. Well,
your Reverence, two and one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, two and one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Binder opened the kitchen door and
shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two liver sausages and one blood-sausage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Evening!” growled Rejzek, the journalist,
entering the room. “It’s cold,
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a very pleasant evening,” chirped
Mr. Binder. “We don’t get company like
this every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s the news?” inquired
Father Jost gaily. “What’s going on in
the editorial sanctum? Ah, yes, I used to
write for the papers myself in my young
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, that fellow Blahous mentioned
me in the paper too that time,” said
Mr. Brych. “I’ve still got the cutting
somewhere. ‘The Apostle of Kuzenda’s
Sect,’ or something like that, he called me.
Yes, yes, those were the days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have supper,” ordered Mr. Rejzek.
Mr. Binder and his daughter were already
setting the sausages on the table. They
were still sizzling, covered with frothing
bubbles of fat, and they reclined upon
crisp sauerkraut like Turkish odalisques on
cushions. Father Jost clicked his tongue
resoundingly and cut into the first beauty
before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid,” said Mr. Brych after a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm,” came from Mr. Rejzek after a
lengthier interval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Binder, these do you credit,” said the
Canon approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence ensued, full of appreciation and
pious meditations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allspice,” contributed Mr. Brych. “I
love the smell of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it mustn’t be too much in evidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, this is just as it should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the skin must be just crisp
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mhm.” And again conversation ceased
for a space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sauerkraut must be nice and
white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Moravia,” said Mr. Brych, “they
make the sauerkraut like a sort of porridge. I
was there as an apprentice. It’s quite runny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come,” exclaimed Father Jost.
“Sauerkraut has to be strained. Don’t
talk such nonsense. Why, the stuff wouldn’t
be fit to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there you are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they do eat it
that way down there. With spoons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrible!” cried the Canon, marvelling.
“What extraordinary people they
must be, friends! Why, sauerkraut should
only just be greased, shouldn’t it, Mr.
Binder? I don’t understand how anyone
could have it any other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know,” said Mr. Brych meditatively,
“it’s just the same with sauerkraut
as it is with religion. One man can’t
understand how another can believe anything
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, enough of that!” protested Father
Jost. “Why, I’d sooner believe in Mahomet
than eat sauerkraut made any other way.
After all, reason teaches one that sauerkraut
ought only to be greased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And doesn’t reason teach one one’s
religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our religion, certainly,” said the Canon
decisively. “But the others are not based
on reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ve got back again to just
where we were before the war,” sighed
Mr. Brych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People are always getting back just
where they used to be,” observed Mr.
Binder. “That’s what Mr. Kuzenda is
always saying. ‘Binder,’ he often says, ‘the
truth can never be defeated. You know,
Binder,’ he says, ‘that God of ours on the
dredge in those days wasn’t so bad, nor
was yours on the merry-go-round, and yet,
you see, they’ve both of them vanished.
Everyone believes in his own superior God,
but he doesn’t believe in another man, or
credit him with believing in something
good. People should first of all believe in
other people, and the rest would soon follow.’
That’s what Mr. Kuzenda always says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” assented Mr. Brych. “A
man may certainly think that another religion
is a bad one, but he oughtn’t to think
that the man who follows it is a low, vile,
and treacherous fellow. And the same
applies to politics and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s what so many people have
hated and killed each other for,” Father Jost
declared. “You know, the greater the
things are in which a man believes, the more
fiercely he despises those who do not believe
in them. And yet the greatest of all beliefs
would be belief in one’s fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everyone has the best of feelings towards
mankind in general, but not towards the individual
man. We’ll kill men, but we want
to save mankind. And that isn’t right,
your Reverence. The world will be an evil
place as long as people don’t believe in
other people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Binder,” said Father Jost thoughtfully,
“I wonder if you would make me
some of that Moravian sauerkraut tomorrow.
I’d like to try it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has to be partly stewed and then
steamed, and done like that with a fried
sausage it’s very good. Every religion
and every truth has something good in it;
if it’s only the fact that it suits somebody
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was opened from outside, and a
policeman stepped in. He was chilled to
the bone and wanted a glass of rum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it’s you, is it, Sergeant Hruska,”
said Brych. “Well now, where have you
come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ve been up in Zizkov,” answered
the policeman, pulling off his enormous
gloves. “There was a raid on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you catch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a couple of roughs, and a few
undesirables. And then at number 1006—in
the cellar of the house, I mean—there
was a den.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of den?” inquired Mr.
Rejzek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Karburator den, sir. They had set
up a tiny Karburator down there out of an
old pre-war motor. A very low crowd has
been going down there and holding orgies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of orgies do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, disorderly behaviour. They pray
and sing and have visions and prophesy and
perform miracles, and all that sort of business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t that allowed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s forbidden by the police. You
see, it’s something like those dens where
they smoke opium. We found one of them
in the Old Town. We’ve routed out seven
of these Karburator caverns already. An
awful gang used to collect there: vagrants,
loose women, and other doubtful characters.
That’s why it’s forbidden. It’s a breach of
the peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are there many haunts of this
kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now. I think this one was the
last of the Karburators.”</p>
