A more exact term would have been Komburator, Atomic Kettle, Karbowatt, Disintegrator, Motor M, Bondymover, Hylergon, Molecular Disintegration Dynamo, E.W., and other designations which were later proposed. It was, of course, the bad one that was generally adopted. <cite>—Karel Čapek</cite> <a href="2.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
